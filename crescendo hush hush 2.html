<p></p>PROLOGUE</p>
<p>COLDWATER, MAINE FOURTEEN MONTHS AGO</p>
<p>THEFINGERSOFTHETHORN-APPLETREECLAWED at the windowpane</p>
<p>behind Harrison Grey, and he dog-eared his page, no longer</p>
<p>able to read through the racket.A furious spring wind had hurled</p>
<p>itself against the farmhouse all night, howling and whistling,</p>
<p>causing the shutters to slam against the clapboards with a</p>
<p>repetitive bang! bang! bang! The calendar may have been</p>
<p>turned to March, but Harrison knew better than to think spring</p>
<p>was on its way. With a storm blowing in, he wouldn’t be</p>
<p>surprised to find the countryside frozen in icy whiteness by</p>
<p>morning.</p>
<p>To drown out the wind’s piercing cry, Harrison punched the</p>
<p>remote, turning up Bononcini’s “Ombra mai fu.” Then he set</p>
<p>another log on the fire, asking himself, not for the first time, if he</p>
<p>would have bought the farmhouse had he known how much fuel</p>
<p>it took to warm one little room, let alone all nine.</p>
<p>The phone shrilled.</p>
<p>Harrison picked it up halfway through the second ring,</p>
<p>expecting to hear the voice of his daughter’s best friend, who</p>
<p>had the annoying habit of calling at the latest possible hour the</p>
<p>night before homework was due.</p>
<p>Shallow, rapid breathing sounded in his ear before a voice</p>
<p>broke the static. “We need to meet. How soon can you be</p>
<p>here?”</p>
<p>The voice floated through Harrison, a ghost from his past,</p>
<p>leaving him bone cold. It had been a long time since he’d heard</p>
<p>the voice, and hearing it now could only mean something had</p>
<p>gone wrong. Terribly wrong. He realized the phone in his hand</p>
<p>was slick with sweat, his posture rigid.</p>
<p>“An hour,” he answered flatly.</p>
<p>He was slow to replace the handset. He shut his eyes, his</p>
<p>mind unwillingly traveling back. There had been a time, fifteen</p>
<p>years ago, when he froze at the sound of the phone ringing, the</p>
<p>seconds pounding out like drums as he waited for the voice on</p>
<p>the other end to speak. Over time, as one peaceful year</p>
<p>replaced another, he’d eventually convinced himself he was a</p>
<p>man who’d outrun the secrets of his past. He was a man living a</p>
<p>normal life, a man with a beautiful family. A man with nothing to</p>
<p>fear.</p>
<p>In the kitchen, standing over the sink, Harrison poured</p>
<p>himself a glass of water and tossed it back. It was full dark</p>
<p>outside, and his waxen reflection stared back from the window</p>
<p>straight ahead. Harrison nodded, as if to tell himself everything</p>
<p>would be all right. But his eyes were heavy with lies.</p>
<p>He loosened his tie to relieve the tightness within him that</p>
<p>seemed to stretch his skin, and poured a second glass. The</p>
<p>seemed to stretch his skin, and poured a second glass. The</p>
<p>water swam uneasily inside him, threatening to come back up.</p>
<p>Setting the glass in the basin of the sink, he reached for the car</p>
<p>keys on the counter, hesitating once as if to change his mind.</p>
<p>Harrison eased the car to the curb and killed the headlights.</p>
<p>Sitting in darkness, breath smoking, he took in the ramshackle</p>
<p>brick row houses in a seedy section of Portland. It had been</p>
<p>years—fifteen to be exact—since he had set foot in the</p>
<p>neighborhood, and relying on his rusty memory, he wasn’t sure</p>
<p>he was in the right place. He popped open the glove box and</p>
<p>retrieved a time-yellowed scrap of paper. 1565 Monroe. He</p>
<p>was about to swing out of the car, but the silence on the streets</p>
<p>bothered him. Reaching beneath his seat, he pulled out a</p>
<p>loaded Smith & Wesson and tucked it into the waistband of his</p>
<p>pants at the small of his back. He hadn’t aimed a gun since</p>
<p>college, and never outside a shooting range. The only clear</p>
<p>thought in his throbbing head was that he hoped he could still</p>
<p>say as much an hour from now.</p>
<p>The tap of Harrison’s shoes sounded loud on the deserted</p>
<p>pavement, but he ignored the rhythm, choosing instead to focus</p>
<p>his attention on the shadows cast by the silver moon. Hunkering</p>
<p>deeper into his coat, he passed cramped dirt yards boxed in by</p>
<p>chain-link fences, the houses beyond them dark and eerily</p>
<p>quiet. Twice he felt as if he was being followed, but when he</p>
<p>glanced back, there was no one.</p>
<p>At 1565 Monroe, he let himself through the gate and circled</p>
<p>around to the back of the house. He knocked once and saw a</p>
<p>shadow move behind the lace curtains.</p>
<p>The door cracked.</p>
<p>“It’s me,” Harrison said, keeping his voice low.</p>
<p>The door opened just wide enough to admit him.</p>
<p>“Were you followed?” he was asked.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“She’s in trouble.”</p>
<p>Harrison’s heart quickened. “What kind of trouble?”</p>
<p>“Once she turns sixteen, he’ll come for her. You need to take</p>
<p>her far away. Someplace where he’ll never find her.”</p>
<p>Harrison shook his head. “I don’t understand—”</p>
<p>He was cut off by a menacing glare. “When we made this</p>
<p>agreement, I told you there would be things you couldn’t</p>
<p>understand. Sixteen is a cursed age in—in my world. That’s all</p>
<p>you need to know,” he finished brusquely.</p>
<p>The two men watched each other, until at last Harrison gave</p>
<p>a wary nod.</p>
<p>“You have to cover your tracks,” he was told. “Wherever you</p>
<p>go, you have to start over. No one can know you came from</p>
<p>Maine. No one. He’ll never stop looking for her. Do you</p>
<p>understand?”</p>
<p>“I understand.” But would his wife? Would Nora?</p>
<p>Harrison’s vision was adapting to the darkness, and he</p>
<p>noted with curious disbelief that the man standing before him</p>
<p>appeared not to have aged a day since their last meeting. In</p>
<p>fact, he hadn’t aged a day since college, when they’d met as</p>
<p>roommates and become fast friends. A trick of the shadows?</p>
<p>Harrison wondered. There was nothing else to attribute it to.</p>
<p>One thing had changed, though. There was a small scar at the</p>
<p>base of his friend’s throat. Harrison took a closer look at the</p>
<p>disfigurement and flinched. A burn mark, raised and shiny,</p>
<p>hardly larger than a quarter. It was in the shape of a clenched</p>
<p>fist. To his shock and horror, Harrison realized his friend had</p>
<p>been branded. Like cattle.</p>
<p>His friend sensed the direction of Harrison’s gaze, and his</p>
<p>eyes turned steely, defensive. “There are people who want to</p>
<p>destroy me. Who want to demoralize and dehumanize me.</p>
<p>Together with a trusted friend, I’ve formed a society. More</p>
<p>members are being initiated all the time.” He stopped midbreath,</p>
<p>as if unsure how much more he should say, then finished</p>
<p>hastily, “We organized the society to give us protection, and I’ve</p>
<p>sworn allegiance to it. If you know me as well as you once did,</p>
<p>you know I’ll do whatever it takes to protect my interests.” He</p>
<p>paused and added almost absently, “And my future.”</p>
<p>“They branded you,” Harrison said, hoping his friend didn’t</p>
<p>detect the repulsion that shuddered through him.</p>
<p>His friend merely looked at him.</p>
<p>After a moment, Harrison nodded, signaling he understood,</p>
<p>even if he didn’t accept it. The less he knew, the better. His</p>
<p>friend had made that clear too many times to count. “Is there</p>
<p>anything else I can do?”</p>
<p>“Just keep her safe.”</p>
<p>Harrison pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose. He</p>
<p>began awkwardly, “I thought you might like to know she’s grown</p>
<p>up healthy and strong. We named her Nor—”</p>
<p>up healthy and strong. We named her Nor—”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be reminded of her name,” his friend</p>
<p>interrupted harshly. “I’ve done everything in my power to stamp it</p>
<p>out from my mind. I don’t want to know anything about her. Iwant</p>
<p>my mind washed of any trace of her, so I’ve got nothing to give</p>
<p>that bastard.” He turned his back, and Harrison took the gesture</p>
<p>to mean the conversation was over. Harrison stood a moment,</p>
<p>so many questions at the tip of his tongue, but at the same time,</p>
<p>knowing nothing good would come from pressing. Stifling his</p>
<p>need to make sense of this dark world his daughter had done</p>
<p>nothing to deserve, he let himself out.</p>
<p>He’d only made it a half block when a gunshot ripped through</p>
<p>the night. Instinctively Harrison dropped low and whirled around.</p>
<p>His friend. A second shot was fired, and without thinking, he ran</p>
<p>in a dead sprint back toward the house. He shoved through the</p>
<p>gate and cut around the side yard. He had almost rounded the</p>
<p>final corner when arguing voices caused him to stop. Despite</p>
<p>the cold, he was sweating. The backyard was shrouded in</p>
<p>darkness, and he inched along the garden wall, careful to avoid</p>
<p>kicking loose stones that would give him away, until the back</p>
<p>door came into sight.</p>
<p>“Last chance,” said a smooth, calm voice Harrison didn’t</p>
<p>recognize.</p>
<p>“Go to hell,” his friend spat.</p>
<p>A third gunshot. His friend bellowed in pain, and the shooter</p>
<p>called over him, “Where is she?”</p>
<p>Heart hammering, Harrison knew he had to act. Another five</p>
<p>seconds and it could be too late. He slid his hand to his lower</p>
<p>back and drew the gun. Two-handing it to steady his grip, he</p>
<p>moved toward the doorway, approaching the dark-haired</p>
<p>shooter from behind. Harrison saw his friend beyond the</p>
<p>shooter, but when he made eye contact, his friend’s expression</p>
<p>filled with alarm.</p>
<p>Go!</p>
<p>Harrison heard his friend’s order as loud as a bell, and for a</p>
<p>moment believed it had been shouted out loud. But when the</p>
<p>shooter didn’t spin around in surprise, Harrison realized with</p>
<p>cold confusion that his friend’s voice had sounded inside his</p>
<p>head.</p>
<p>No, Harrison thought back with a silent shake of his head, his</p>
<p>sense of loyalty outweighing what he couldn’t comprehend. This</p>
<p>was the man he’d spent four of the best years of his life with.</p>
<p>The man who’d introduced him to his wife. He wasn’t going to</p>
<p>leave him here at the hands of a killer.</p>
<p>Harrison pulled the trigger. He heard the earsplitting shot and</p>
<p>waited for the shooter to crumple. Harrison shot another time.</p>
<p>And another.</p>
<p>The dark-haired young man turned slowly. For the first time in</p>
<p>his life, Harrison found himself truly afraid. Afraid of the young</p>
<p>man standing before him, gun in hand. Afraid of death. Afraid of</p>
<p>what would become of his family.</p>
<p>He felt the shots rip through him with a searing fire that</p>
<p>seemed to shatter him into a thousand pieces. He dropped to</p>
<p>his knees. He saw his wife’s face blur across his vision,</p>
<p>followed by his daughter’s. He opened his mouth, their names</p>
<p>at his lips, and tried to find a way to say how much he loved</p>
<p>them before it was too late.</p>
<p>The young man had his hands on Harrison now, dragging</p>
<p>him into the alley at the rear of the house. Harrison could feel</p>
<p>consciousness leaving him as he struggled without success to</p>
<p>get his feet under him. He couldn’t fail his daughter. There would</p>
<p>be no one to protect her. This black-haired shooter would find</p>
<p>her and, if his friend was right, kill her.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Harrison asked, the words causing fire to</p>
<p>spread through his chest. He clung to the hope that there was</p>
<p>still time. Maybe he could warn Nora from the next world—a</p>
<p>world that was closing in on him like a thousand falling feathers</p>
<p>painted black.</p>
<p>The young man watched Harrison for a moment before the</p>
<p>faintest of smiles broke his ice-hard expression. “You thought</p>
<p>wrong. It’s definitely too late.”</p>
<p>Harrison looked up sharply, startled that the killer had</p>
<p>guessed his thoughts, and couldn’t help but wonder how many</p>
<p>times the young man had stood in this same position before to</p>
<p>guess a dying man’s final thoughts. Not a few.</p>
<p>As if to prove just how practiced he was, the young man</p>
<p>aimed the gun without a single beat of hesitation, and Harrison</p>
<p>found himself staring into the barrel of the weapon. The light of</p>
<p>the fired shot flared, and it was the last image he saw.</p><p>

<p></p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>DELPHIC BEACH, MAINE</p>
<p>PRESENT DAY</p>
<p>PATCH WAS STANDING BEHIND ME, HIS HANDS on my hips, his body</p>
<p>relaxed. He stood two inches over six feet tall and had a lean,</p>
<p>athletic build that even loose-fit jeans and a T-shirt couldn’t</p>
<p>conceal. The color of his hair gave midnight a run for its money,</p>
<p>with eyes to match. His smile was sexy and warned of trouble,</p>
<p>but I’d made up my mind that not all trouble was bad.</p>
<p>Overhead, fireworks lit up the night sky, raining streams of</p>
<p>color into the Atlantic. The crowd oohed and aahed. It was late</p>
<p>June, and Maine was jumping into summer with both feet,</p>
<p>celebrating the beginning of two months of sun, sand, and</p>
<p>tourists with deep pockets. Iwas celebrating two months of sun,</p>
<p>sand, and plenty of exclusive time with Patch. I’d enrolled in one</p>
<p>summer school course—chemistry—and had every intention of</p>
<p>letting Patch monopolize the rest of my free time.</p>
<p>The fire department was setting off the fireworks on a dock</p>
<p>that couldn’t have been more than two hundred yards down the</p>
<p>beach from where we stood, and I felt the boom of each one</p>
<p>vibrate in the sand under my feet. Waves crashed into the</p>
<p>beach just down the hill, and carnival music tinkled at top</p>
<p>volume. The smell of cotton candy, popcorn, and sizzling meat</p>
<p>hung thick in the air, and my stomach reminded me I hadn’t</p>
<p>eaten since lunch.</p>
<p>“I’m going to grab a cheeseburger,” I told Patch. “Want</p>
<p>anything?”</p>
<p>“Nothing on the menu.”</p>
<p>I smiled. “Why, Patch, are you flirting with me?”</p>
<p>He kissed the crown of my head. “Not yet. I’ll grab your</p>
<p>cheeseburger. Enjoy the last of the fireworks.”</p>
<p>I snagged one of his belt loops to stop him. “Thanks, but I’m</p>
<p>ordering. I can’t take the guilt.”</p>
<p>He raised his eyebrows in inquiry.</p>
<p>“When was the last time the girl at the hamburger stand let</p>
<p>you pay for food?”</p>
<p>“It’s been a while.”</p>
<p>“It’s been never. Stay here. If she sees you, I’ll spend the rest</p>
<p>of the night with a guilty conscience.”</p>
<p>Patch opened his wallet and pulled out a twenty. “Leave her a</p>
<p>nice tip.”</p>
<p>It was my turn to raise my eyebrows. “Trying to redeem</p>
<p>yourself for all those times you took free food?”</p>
<p>“Last time I paid, she chased me down and shoved the</p>
<p>money in my pocket. I’m trying to avoid another groping.”</p>
<p>It sounded made up, but knowing Patch, it was probably true.</p>
<p>I hunted down the end of a long line that wrapped around the</p>
<p>hamburger stand, finding it near the entrance to the indoor</p>
<p>carousel. Judging by the size of the line, I estimated a fifteen-</p>
<p>minute wait just to place my order. One hamburger stand on the</p>
<p>entire beach. It felt un-American.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of restless waiting, I was taking what</p>
<p>must have been my tenth bored look around when I spotted</p>
<p>Marcie Millar standing two spots back. Marcie and I had gone</p>
<p>to school together since kindergarten, and in the eleven years</p>
<p>since, I’d seen more of her than I cared to remember. Because</p>
<p>of her, the whole school had seen more of my underwear than</p>
<p>necessary. In junior high, Marcie’s usual MO was stealing my</p>
<p>bra from my gym locker and pinning it to the bulletin board</p>
<p>outside the main offices, but occasionally she got creative and</p>
<p>used it as a centerpiece in the cafeteria—both my A cups filled</p>
<p>with vanilla pudding and topped with maraschino cherries.</p>
<p>Classy, I know. Marcie’s skirts were two sizes too small and five</p>
<p>inches too short. Her hair was strawberry blond, and she had</p>
<p>the shape of a Popsicle stick—turn her sideways and she</p>
<p>practically disappeared. If there was a scoreboard keeping</p>
<p>track of wins and losses between us, I was pretty sure Marcie</p>
<p>had double my score.</p>
<p>“Hey,” I said, unintentionally catching her eye and not seeing</p>
<p>any way around a bare-minimum greeting.</p>
<p>“Hey,” she returned in what scraped by as a civil tone.</p>
<p>Seeing Marcie at Delphic Beach tonight was like playing</p>
<p>What’s Wrong with This Picture? Marcie’s dad owned the</p>
<p>Toyota dealership in Coldwater, her family lived in an upscale</p>
<p>hillside neighborhood, and the Millars took pride in being the</p>
<p>only citizens of Coldwater welcomed into the prestigious</p>
<p>Harraseeket Yacht Club. At this very minute, Marcie’s parents</p>
<p>Harraseeket Yacht Club. At this very minute, Marcie’s parents</p>
<p>were probably in Freeport, racing sailboats and ordering</p>
<p>salmon.</p>
<p>By contrast, Delphic was a slum beach. The thought of a</p>
<p>yacht club was laughable. The sole restaurant came in the form</p>
<p>of a whitewashed hamburger stand with your choice of ketchup</p>
<p>or mustard. On a good day, fries were offered in the mix. The</p>
<p>entertainment slanted toward loud arcades and bumper cars,</p>
<p>and after dark, the parking lot was known to sell more drugs</p>
<p>than a pharmacy.</p>
<p>Not the kind of atmosphere Mr. and Mrs. Millar would have</p>
<p>their daughter polluting herself in.</p>
<p>“Could we move any slower, people?” Marcie called up the</p>
<p>line. “Some of us are starving to death back here.”</p>
<p>“There’s only one person working the counter,” I told her.</p>
<p>“So? They should hire more people. Supply and demand.”</p>
<p>Given her GPA, Marcie was the last person who should be</p>
<p>spouting economics.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, I’d made progress, and stood close</p>
<p>enough to the hamburger stand to read the word MUSTARD</p>
<p>scribbled in black Magic Marker on the communal yellow squirt</p>
<p>bottle. Behind me, Marcie did the whole shifting-weightbetween-hips-and-sighing</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>“Starving with a capital S,” she complained.</p>
<p>The guy in line ahead of me paid and carried off his food.</p>
<p>“A cheeseburger and a Coke,” I told the girl working the</p>
<p>stand. While she stood over the grill making my order, I turned back</p>
<p>to Marcie. “So. Who are you here with?” I didn’t particularly care</p>
<p>who she’d come with, especially since we didn’t share any of</p>
<p>the same friends, but my sense of courtesy got the better of me.</p>
<p>Besides, Marcie hadn’t done anything overtly rude to me in</p>
<p>weeks. And we’d stood in relative peace the past fifteen</p>
<p>minutes. Maybe it was the beginning of a truce. Bygones and all</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>She yawned, as if talking to me was more boring than</p>
<p>waiting in line and staring at the backs of people’s heads. “No</p>
<p>offense, but I’m not in a chatty mood. I’ve been in line for what</p>
<p>feels like five hours, waiting on an incompetent girl who</p>
<p>obviously can’t cook two hamburgers at once.”</p>
<p>The girl behind the counter had her head ducked low,</p>
<p>concentrating on peeling premade hamburger patties from the</p>
<p>wax paper, but I knew she’d heard. She probably hated her job.</p>
<p>She probably secretly spat on the hamburger patties when she</p>
<p>turned her back. I wouldn’t be surprised if at the end of her shift,</p>
<p>she went out to her car and wept.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t your dad mind that you’re hanging out at Delphic</p>
<p>Beach?” I asked Marcie, narrowing my eyes ever so slightly.</p>
<p>“Might tarnish the estimable Millar family reputation. Especially</p>
<p>now that your dad’s been accepted into the Harraseeket Yacht</p>
<p>Club.”</p>
<p>Marcie’s expression cooled. “I’m surprised your dad doesn’t</p>
<p>mind you’re here. Oh, wait. That’s right. He’s dead.”</p>
<p>My initial reaction was shock. My second was indignation at</p>
<p>her cruelty.A knot of anger swelled in my throat.</p>
<p>“What?” she argued with a one-shoulder shrug. “He’s dead.</p>
<p>It’s a fact. Do you want me to lie about the facts?”</p>
<p>“What did I ever do to you?”</p>
<p>“You were born.”</p>
<p>Her complete lack of sensitivity yanked me inside out—so</p>
<p>much so that I didn’t even have a comeback. I snatched my</p>
<p>cheeseburger and Coke off the counter, leaving the twenty in its</p>
<p>place. I wanted badly to hurry back to Patch, but this was</p>
<p>between me and Marcie. If I showed up now, one look at my</p>
<p>face would tell Patch something was wrong. I didn’t need to</p>
<p>drag him into the middle. Taking a moment alone to collect</p>
<p>myself, I found a bench within sight of the hamburger stand and</p>
<p>sat down as gracefully as I could, not wanting to give Marcie the</p>
<p>power to ruin my night. The only thing that could make this</p>
<p>moment worse was knowing she was watching, satisfied she’d</p>
<p>stuffed me into a little black hole of self-pity. I took a bite of</p>
<p>cheeseburger, but it left a bad taste in my mouth.All I could think</p>
<p>of was dead meat. Dead cows. My own dead father.</p>
<p>I threw the cheeseburger into the trash and kept walking,</p>
<p>feeling tears slip down the back of my throat.</p>
<p>Hugging my arms tightly at the elbows, I hurried toward the</p>
<p>shack of bathrooms at the edge of the parking lot, hoping to</p>
<p>make it behind a stall door before the tears started falling.</p>
<p>There was a steady line trickling out of the women’s room, but I</p>
<p>edged my way through the doorway and positioned myself in</p>
<p>front of one of the grime-coated mirrors. Even under the lowwatt</p>
<p>bulb, I could tell my eyes were red and glassy. Iwet a paper</p>
<p>towel and pressed it to my eyes. What was Marcie’s problem?</p>
<p>towel and pressed it to my eyes. What was Marcie’s problem?</p>
<p>What had I ever done to her that was cruel enough to deserve</p>
<p>this?</p>
<p>Drawing a few stabilizing breaths, I squared my shoulders</p>
<p>and constructed a brick wall in my mind, placing Marcie on the</p>
<p>far side of it. What did I care what she said? I didn’t even like</p>
<p>her. Her opinion meant nothing. She was rude and self-centered</p>
<p>and attacked below the belt. She didn’t know me, and she</p>
<p>definitely didn’t know my dad. Crying over a single word that fell</p>
<p>from her mouth was a waste.</p>
<p>Get over it, I told myself.</p>
<p>I waited until the red rimming my eyes faded before leaving</p>
<p>the restroom. I roamed the crowd, looking for Patch, and found</p>
<p>him at one of the ball toss games, his back to me. Rixon was at</p>
<p>his side, probably wagering money on Patch’s inability to knock</p>
<p>over a single weighted bowling pin. Rixon was a fallen angel</p>
<p>who had a long history with Patch, and their ties ran deep to the</p>
<p>point of brotherhood. Patch didn’t let many people into his life,</p>
<p>and trusted even fewer, but if there was one person who knew</p>
<p>all his secrets, it was Rixon.</p>
<p>Up until two months ago, Patch had also been a fallen angel.</p>
<p>Then he saved my life, earned his wings back, and became my</p>
<p>guardian angel. He was supposed to play for the good guys</p>
<p>now, but I secretly sensed that his connection to Rixon, and the</p>
<p>world of fallen angels, meant more to him. And even though I</p>
<p>didn’t want to admit it, I sensed that he regretted the</p>
<p>archangels’ decision to make him my guardian. After all, it</p>
<p>wasn’t what he wanted.</p>
<p>He wanted to become human.</p>
<p>My cell phone rang, jarring me from my thoughts. It was my</p>
<p>best friend Vee’s ringtone, but I let voice mail take her call. With</p>
<p>a squeeze of guilt, I vaguely noted it was the second call of hers</p>
<p>I’d avoided today. I justified my guilt with the thought that I’d see</p>
<p>her first thing tomorrow. Patch, on the other hand, I wouldn’t see</p>
<p>again until tomorrow evening. I planned to enjoy every minute I</p>
<p>had with him.</p>
<p>I watched him pitch the ball at a table neatly lined with six</p>
<p>bowling pins, my stomach giving a little flutter when his T-shirt</p>
<p>crept up in the back, revealing a stripe of skin. I knew from</p>
<p>experience that every inch of him was hard, defined muscle. His</p>
<p>back was smooth and perfect too, the scars from when he’d</p>
<p>fallen once again replaced with wings—wings I, and every other</p>
<p>human, couldn’t see.</p>
<p>“Five dollars says you can’t do it again,” I said, coming up</p>
<p>behind him.</p>
<p>Patch looked back and grinned. “I don’t want your money,</p>
<p>Angel.”</p>
<p>“Hey now, kids, let’s keep this discussion PG-rated,” Rixon</p>
<p>said.</p>
<p>“All three remaining pins,” I challenged Patch.</p>
<p>“What kind of prize are we talking about?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Bloody hell,” Rixon said. “Can’t this wait until you’re alone?”</p>
<p>Patch gave me a secret smile, then shifted his weight back,</p>
<p>cradling the ball into his chest. He dropped his right shoulder,</p>
<p>brought his arm around, and sent the ball flying forward as hard</p>
<p>as he could. There was a loud crack! and the remaining three</p>
<p>pins scattered off the table.</p>
<p>“Aye, now you’re in trouble, lass,” Rixon shouted at me over</p>
<p>the commotion caused by a pocket of onlookers, who were</p>
<p>clapping and whistling for Patch.</p>
<p>Patch leaned back against the booth and arched his</p>
<p>eyebrows at me. The gesture said it all: Pay up.</p>
<p>“You got lucky,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’m about to get lucky.”</p>
<p>“Choose a prize,” the old man running the booth barked at</p>
<p>Patch, bending to pick up the fallen pins.</p>
<p>“The purple bear,” Patch said, and accepted a hideouslooking</p>
<p>teddy bear with matted purple fur. He held it out to me.</p>
<p>“For me?” I said, pressing a hand to my heart.</p>
<p>“You like the rejects. At the grocery store, you always take the</p>
<p>dented cans. I’ve been paying attention.” He hooked his finger</p>
<p>in the waistband of my jeans and pulled me close. “Let’s get out</p>
<p>of here.”</p>
<p>“What did you have in mind?” But I was all warm and fluttery</p>
<p>inside, because I knew exactly what he had in mind.</p>
<p>“Your place.”</p>
<p>I shook my head. “Not going to happen. My mom’s home.</p>
<p>We could go to your place,” I hinted. We’d been together two months, and I still didn’t know where</p>
<p>Patch lived. And not for lack of trying. Two weeks into a</p>
<p>relationship seemed long enough to be invited over, especially</p>
<p>since Patch lived alone. Two months felt like overkill. Iwas trying</p>
<p>to be patient, but my curiosity kept getting in the way. I knew</p>
<p>nothing about the private, intimate details of Patch’s life, like the</p>
<p>color of paint on his walls. If his can opener was electric or</p>
<p>manual. The brand of soap he showered with. If his sheets were</p>
<p>cotton or silk.</p>
<p>“Let me guess,” I said. “You live in a secret compound buried</p>
<p>in the underbelly of the city.”</p>
<p>“Angel.”</p>
<p>“Are there dishes in the sink? Dirty underwear on the floor?</p>
<p>It’s a lot more private than my place.”</p>
<p>“True, but the answer’s still no.”</p>
<p>“Has Rixon seen your place?”</p>
<p>“Rixon is need-to-know.”</p>
<p>“I’m not need-to-know?”</p>
<p>His mouth twitched. “There’s a dark side to need-to-know.”</p>
<p>“If you showed me, you’d have to kill me?” I guessed.</p>
<p>He wrapped his arms around me and kissed my forehead.</p>
<p>“Close enough. What time’s curfew?”</p>
<p>“Ten. Summer school starts tomorrow.” That, and my mom</p>
<p>had practically taken a part-time job finding opportunities to</p>
<p>drop the knife between me and Patch. If I’d been out with Vee, I</p>
<p>could say with absolute certainty that my curfew would have</p>
<p>stretched to ten thirty. I couldn’t blame my mom for not trusting</p>
<p>Patch—there was a point in my life when I’d felt similarly—but it</p>
<p>would have been extremely convenient if every now and then</p>
<p>she relaxed her vigilance.</p>
<p>Like, say, tonight. Besides, nothing was going to happen.</p>
<p>Not with my guardian angel standing inches away.</p>
<p>Not with my guardian angel standing inches away.</p>
<p>Patch looked at his watch. “Time to roll.”</p>
<p>At 10:04, Patch flipped a U-turn in front of the farmhouse and</p>
<p>parked by the mailbox. He cut the engine and the headlights,</p>
<p>leaving us alone in the dark countryside. We sat that way for</p>
<p>several moments before he said, “Why so quiet,Angel?”</p>
<p>I instantly snapped to attention. “Am I being quiet? Just lost in</p>
<p>thought.”</p>
<p>A barely-there smile curved Patch’s mouth. “Liar. What’s</p>
<p>wrong?”</p>
<p>“You’re good,” I said.</p>
<p>His smile widened a fraction. “Really good.”</p>
<p>“I ran into Marcie Millar at the hamburger stand,” I admitted.</p>
<p>So much for keeping my troubles to myself. Obviously they were</p>
<p>still smoldering under the surface. On the other hand, if I couldn’t</p>
<p>talk to Patch, who could I talk to? Two months ago our</p>
<p>relationship involved a lot of spontaneous kissing inside our</p>
<p>cars, outside our cars, under the bleachers, and on top of the</p>
<p>kitchen table. It also involved a lot of wandering hands, tousled</p>
<p>hair, and smudged lip gloss. But it was so much more than that</p>
<p>now. I felt connected to Patch emotionally. His friendship meant</p>
<p>more to me than a hundred casual acquaintances. When my</p>
<p>dad died, he’d left a huge hollowness inside me that threatened</p>
<p>to eat me from the inside out. The emptiness was still there, but</p>
<p>the ache didn’t cut half as deep. I didn’t see the point in staying</p>
<p>frozen in the past, when I had everything Iwanted right now. And</p>
<p>I had Patch to thank for that. “She was thoughtful enough to</p>
<p>remind me my dad is dead.”</p>
<p>“Want me to talk to her?”</p>
<p>“That sounds a bit The Godfather.”</p>
<p>“What started the war between the two of you?”</p>
<p>“That’s the thing. I don’t even know. It used to be over who got</p>
<p>the last chocolate milk in the lunch crate. Then one day in junior</p>
<p>high, Marcie marched into school and spray-painted ‘whore’ on</p>
<p>my locker. She didn’t even try to be sneaky about it. The whole</p>
<p>school was looking on.”</p>
<p>“She went postal just like that? No reason?”</p>
<p>“Yup.” No reason Iwas aware of, anyway.</p>
<p>He tucked one of my curls behind my ear. “Who’s winning the</p>
<p>war?”</p>
<p>“Marcie, but not by much.”</p>
<p>His smile grew. “Go get her, Tiger.”</p>
<p>“And here’s another thing. Whore? In junior high, I hadn’t</p>
<p>even kissed anyone. Marcie should have spray-painted her own</p>
<p>locker.”</p>
<p>“Starting to sound like you’ve got a hang-up, Angel.” He slid</p>
<p>his finger under the strap of my tank top, his touch sending</p>
<p>electricity humming along my skin. “I bet I can take your mind off</p>
<p>Marcie.”</p>
<p>A few lights were burning in the upper level of the farmhouse,</p>
<p>but since I didn’t see my mom’s face pressed up against any of</p>
<p>the windows, I figured we had some time. I unlatched my seat</p>
<p>belt and bent across the console, finding Patch’s mouth in the</p>
<p>darkness. I kissed him slowly, savoring the taste of sea salt on</p>
<p>his skin. He’d shaved this morning, but now his stubble rasped</p>
<p>my chin. His mouth skimmed my throat and I felt a touch of</p>
<p>tongue, causing my heart to bump against my ribs.</p>
<p>His kiss moved to my bare shoulder. He nudged the strap of</p>
<p>my tank top down and brushed his mouth lower along my arm.</p>
<p>Right then, I wanted to be as close to him as I could. I never</p>
<p>wanted him to go. I needed him in my life right now, and</p>
<p>tomorrow, and the day after. I needed him like I’d never needed</p>
<p>anyone.</p>
<p>I crawled over the console, straddling his lap. I slid my hands</p>
<p>up his chest, grasped him behind the neck, and pulled him in.</p>
<p>His arms circled my waist, locking me against him, and I</p>
<p>snuggled in deeper.</p>
<p>Caught up in the moment, I ran my hands under his shirt,</p>
<p>thinking only of how I loved the feel of his body heat spreading</p>
<p>into my hands. As soon as my fingers brushed the place on his</p>
<p>back where his wing scars used to be, a distant light exploded</p>
<p>at the back of my mind. Perfect darkness, ruptured by one burst</p>
<p>of blinding light. It was like watching a cosmic phenomenon in</p>
<p>space from millions of miles away. I felt my mind being sucked</p>
<p>inside Patch’s, into all the thousands of private memories</p>
<p>stored there, when suddenly he took my hand and slid it lower,</p>
<p>away from the place where his wings joined with his back, and</p>
<p>everything spun sharply back to normal.</p>
<p>“Nice try,” he murmured, his lips brushing mine as he spoke.</p>
<p>I nibbled his lower lip. “If you could see into my past just by</p>
<p>touching my back, you’d have a hard time resisting the</p>
<p>temptation too.”</p>
<p>“I have a hard time keeping my hands off you without that</p>
<p>“I have a hard time keeping my hands off you without that</p>
<p>added bonus.”</p>
<p>I laughed, but my expression quickly turned serious. Even</p>
<p>with considerable concentration, I could hardly remember what</p>
<p>life had been like without Patch. At night, when I lay in bed, I</p>
<p>could remember with perfect clarity the low timbre of his laugh,</p>
<p>the way his smile curved slightly higher on the right, the touch of</p>
<p>his hands—hot, smooth, and delicious on my skin. But it was</p>
<p>only with serious effort that I could pick up memories from the</p>
<p>previous sixteen years. Maybe because those memories paled</p>
<p>in comparison to Patch. Or maybe because there was nothing</p>
<p>good there at all.</p>
<p>“Don’t ever leave me,” I told Patch, hooking a finger in the</p>
<p>collar of his shirt and pulling him close.</p>
<p>“You’re mine, Angel,” he murmured, brushing the words</p>
<p>across my jawbone as I arched my neck higher, inviting him to</p>
<p>kiss everywhere. “You have me forever.”</p>
<p>“Show me you mean it,” I said solemnly.</p>
<p>He studied me a moment, then reached behind his neck and</p>
<p>unclasped the plain silver chain he’d worn since the day I met</p>
<p>him. I had no idea where the chain had come from, or the</p>
<p>significance behind it, but I sensed it was important to him. It</p>
<p>was the only piece of jewelry he wore, and he kept it tucked</p>
<p>under his shirt, next to his skin. I’d never seen him take it off.</p>
<p>His hands slid to the nape of my neck, where he fastened the</p>
<p>chain. The metal fell on my skin, still warm from him.</p>
<p>“I was given this when I was an archangel,” he said. “To help</p>
<p>me discern truth from deception.”</p>
<p>I fingered it gently, in awe of its importance. “Does it still</p>
<p>work?”</p>
<p>“Not for me.” He interlaced our fingers and turned my hand</p>
<p>over to kiss my knuckles. “Your turn.”</p>
<p>I twisted a small copper ring off the middle finger of my left</p>
<p>hand and held it out to him. A heart was hand-carved into the</p>
<p>smooth underside of the ring.</p>
<p>Patch held the ring between his fingers, silently examining it.</p>
<p>“My dad gave it to me the week before he was killed,” I said.</p>
<p>Patch’s eyes flicked up. “I can’t take this.”</p>
<p>“It’s the most important thing in the world to me. I want you to</p>
<p>have it.” I bent his fingers, folding them around the ring.</p>
<p>“Nora.” He hesitated. “I can’t take this.”</p>
<p>“Promise me you’ll keep it. Promise me nothing will ever</p>
<p>come between us.” I held his eyes, refusing to let him turn away.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be without you. I don’t want this to ever end.”</p>
<p>Patch’s eyes were slate black, darker than a million secrets</p>
<p>stacked on top of each other. He dropped his gaze to the ring in</p>
<p>his hand, turning it over slowly.</p>
<p>“Swear you’ll never stop loving me,” Iwhispered.</p>
<p>Ever so slightly, he nodded.</p>
<p>I gripped his collar and pulled him against me, kissing him</p>
<p>more fervently, sealing the promise between us. I locked my</p>
<p>fingers between his, the sharp edge of the ring biting into our</p>
<p>palms. Nothing I did seemed to bring me close enough to him,</p>
<p>no amount of him was enough. The ring ground deeper into my</p>
<p>hand, until Iwas certain it had broken skin.A blood promise. When I thought my chest might collapse without air, I pulled</p>
<p>When I thought my chest might collapse without air, I pulled</p>
<p>away, resting my forehead against his. My eyes were shut, my</p>
<p>breathing causing my shoulders to rise and fall. “I love you,” I</p>
<p>murmured. “More than I think I should.”</p>
<p>I waited for him to answer, but instead his hold on me</p>
<p>tightened, almost protectively. He turned his head toward the</p>
<p>woods across the road.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I heard something.”</p>
<p>“That was me saying I love you,” I said, smiling as I traced his</p>
<p>mouth with my finger.</p>
<p>I expected him to return the smile, but his eyes were still fixed</p>
<p>on the trees, which cast shifting shadows as their branches</p>
<p>nodded in the breeze.</p>
<p>“What’s out there?” I asked, following his gaze. “A coyote?”</p>
<p>“Something isn’t right.”</p>
<p>My blood chilled, and I slid off his lap. “You’re starting to</p>
<p>scare me. Is it a bear?” We hadn’t seen bears in years, but the</p>
<p>farmhouse was pushed out on the very edge of town, and bears</p>
<p>were known to wander closer to town after hibernation, when</p>
<p>they were hungry and searching for food.</p>
<p>“Turn the headlights on and honk the horn,” I said. Training my</p>
<p>eyes on the woods, Iwatched for movement. My heart edged up</p>
<p>a little, remembering the time my parents and I had watched</p>
<p>from the farmhouse windows as a bear rocked our car, smelling</p>
<p>food inside.</p>
<p>Behind me, the porch lights flashed. I didn’t need to turn back</p>
<p>to know my mom was standing in the doorway, frowning and</p>
<p>tapping her foot.</p>
<p>“What is it?” I asked Patch once more. “My mom’s coming</p>
<p>out. Is she safe?”</p>
<p>He turned on the engine and put the Jeep in drive. “Go</p>
<p>inside. There’s something I need to do.”</p>
<p>“Go inside? Are you kidding? What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“Nora!” my mom called, coming down the steps, her tone</p>
<p>aggravated. She stopped five feet from the Jeep and motioned</p>
<p>for me to lower the window.</p>
<p>“Patch?” I tried again.</p>
<p>“I’ll call you later.”</p>
<p>My mom hauled the door open. “Patch,” she acknowledged</p>
<p>curtly.</p>
<p>“Blythe.” He gave a distracted nod.</p>
<p>She turned to me. “You’re four minutes late.”</p>
<p>“Iwas four minutes early yesterday.”</p>
<p>“Rollover minutes don’t work with curfews. Inside. Now.”</p>
<p>Not wanting to leave until Patch answered me, but not seeing</p>
<p>much of a choice, I told him, “Call me.”</p>
<p>He nodded once, but the singular focus to his eyes told me</p>
<p>his thoughts were elsewhere. As soon as I was out of the car</p>
<p>and on solid ground, the Jeep revved forward, not wasting time</p>
<p>accelerating. Wherever Patch was going, it was in a hurry.</p>
<p>“When I give you a curfew, I expect you to keep it,” Mom said.</p>
<p>“Four minutes late,” I said, my tone suggesting she might be</p>
<p>overreacting.</p>
<p>That earned me a stare that had disapproval stamped all</p>
<p>over it. “Last year your dad was killed. A couple months ago,</p>
<p>you had your own brush with death. I think I’ve earned the right</p>
<p>to be over-protective.” She walked stiffly back to the house,</p>
<p>arms clamped over her chest.</p>
<p>Okay, Iwas an unfeeling, insensitive daughter. Point taken.</p>
<p>I turned my attention to the row of trees at the edge of the</p>
<p>road opposite. Nothing looked out of the ordinary. I waited for a</p>
<p>chill to warn me there was something back there, something I</p>
<p>couldn’t see, but nothing felt off. A warm summer breeze rustled</p>
<p>past, the sound of cicadas filling the air. If anything, the woods</p>
<p>looked peaceful under the silver glow of moonlight.</p>
<p>Patch hadn’t seen anything in the woods. He’d turned away</p>
<p>because I’d said three very big, very stupid words, which had</p>
<p>gushed out before I could stop them. What had I been thinking?</p>
<p>No. What was Patch thinking now? Had he driven off to escape</p>
<p>responding? I was pretty sure I knew the answer. And I was</p>
<p>pretty sure it explained why I was left staring at the back of his</p>
<p>Jeep.</p><p>

<p></p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>FOR THE LAST ELEVEN SECONDS, I’D BEEN lying facedown, hugging</p>
<p>my pillow over my head, trying to shut out Chuck Delaney’s</p>
<p>traffic report from downtown Portland, which was coming</p>
<p>through my alarm clock loud and clear. Likewise, I was trying to</p>
<p>shut out the logical part of my brain, which shouted for me to get</p>
<p>dressed, promising repercussions if I didn’t. But the pleasureseeking</p>
<p>part of my brain won out. It clung to my dream—or</p>
<p>rather, the subject of my dream. He had wavy black hair and a</p>
<p>killer smile. At this moment, he was sitting backward on his</p>
<p>motorcycle and I was sitting facing forward, our knees touching.</p>
<p>I curled my fingers into his shirt and pulled him in for a kiss.</p>
<p>In my dream, Patch felt it when I kissed him. Not only on an</p>
<p>emotional level, but a real, physical touch. In my dream, he</p>
<p>became more human than angel. Angels can’t feel physical</p>
<p>sensation—I knew this—but in my dream, Iwanted Patch to feel</p>
<p>the soft, silky pressure of our lips connecting. I wanted him to</p>
<p>feel my fingers pushing through his hair. I needed him to feel the</p>
<p>thrilling and undeniable magnetic field pulling every molecule in</p>
<p>his body toward mine.</p>
<p>Just like I did.</p>
<p>Patch ran his finger under the silver chain at my neck, his</p>
<p>touch sending a shiver of pleasure rippling through me. “I love</p>
<p>you,” he murmured.</p>
<p>Bracing my fingertips on his hard stomach, I leaned in,</p>
<p>stopping just short of a kiss. I love you more, I said, brushing</p>
<p>his mouth as I spoke.</p>
<p>Only, the words didn’t come out. They stayed caught in my</p>
<p>throat. While Patch waited for me to respond, his smile faltered.</p>
<p>I love you, I tried again. Once again, the words stayed</p>
<p>clamped inside.</p>
<p>Patch’s expression turned anxious. “I love you, Nora,” he</p>
<p>repeated.</p>
<p>I nodded frantically, but he’d turned away. He swung off the</p>
<p>motorcycle and left without looking back.</p>
<p>I love you! I yelled after him. I love you, I love you!</p>
<p>But it was as if quicksand had been poured down my throat;</p>
<p>the harder I tried to wrestle the words out, the faster they were</p>
<p>towed under.</p>
<p>Patch was slipping away in a crowd. Night had fallen down</p>
<p>around us in a snap, and I could barely distinguish his black Tshirt</p>
<p>from the hundreds of other dark shirts in the masses. I ran</p>
<p>to catch up, but when I grabbed his arm, it was someone else</p>
<p>who turned around. A girl. It was too dark to get a good read on</p>
<p>her features, but I could tell she was beautiful.</p>
<p>“I love Patch,” she told me, smiling through shocking red</p>
<p>lipstick. “And I’m not afraid to say it.”</p>
<p>“I did say it!” I argued. “Last night I told him!”</p>
<p>I pushed past her, eyes scanning the crowd until I caught a</p>
<p>glimpse of Patch’s trademark blue ball cap. I shoved my way</p>
<p>frantically over to him and reached out to catch his hand.</p>
<p>He turned back, but he’d changed into the same beautiful</p>
<p>girl. “You’re too late,” she said. “I love Patch now.”</p>
<p>“Over to Angie with weather,” Chuck Delaney yapped</p>
<p>cheerfully in my ear.</p>
<p>My eyes sprang open at the word “weather.” I lay in bed a</p>
<p>moment, trying to shake off what was nothing more than a bad</p>
<p>dream, and get my bearings. The weather was announced at</p>
<p>twenty before the hour, and there was no possible way I was</p>
<p>hearing the weather, unless …</p>
<p>Summer school! I’d overslept!</p>
<p>Kicking back the covers, I fled to the closet. Shoving my feet</p>
<p>into the same jeans I’d discarded at the bottom of the closet last</p>
<p>night, I stretched a white tee over my head and layered it with a</p>
<p>lavender cardigan. I speed-dialed Patch but three rings later</p>
<p>was sent to voice mail. “Call me!” I said, pausing a half second</p>
<p>to wonder if he was avoiding me after last night’s big</p>
<p>confession. I’d made up my mind to pretend it had never</p>
<p>happened until it blew over and things returned to normal, but</p>
<p>after this morning’s dream, Iwas beginning to doubt I’d let go of</p>
<p>it that easily. Maybe Patch was having just as hard a time</p>
<p>dropping it. Either way, there wasn’t a lot I could do about it right</p>
<p>now. Even though I could have sworn he’d promised me a ride …</p>
<p>I pushed a headband into my hair in lieu of a hairstyle,</p>
<p>snatched my backpack off the kitchen counter, and rushed out</p>
<p>snatched my backpack off the kitchen counter, and rushed out</p>
<p>the door.</p>
<p>I paused in the driveway long enough to give a scream of</p>
<p>exasperation at the eight-by-ten-foot slab of cement where my</p>
<p>1979 Fiat Spider used to sit. My mom had sold the Spider to</p>
<p>pay off a three-months-delinquent electricity bill, and to stock</p>
<p>our fridge with enough groceries to keep us fed through the end</p>
<p>of the month. She’d even dismissed our housekeeper,</p>
<p>Dorothea, a.k.a. my surrogate parent, to trim expenses.</p>
<p>Sending a hateful thought in the direction of Circumstance, I</p>
<p>slung my backpack over my shoulder and started jogging. Most</p>
<p>people might consider the rural Maine farmhouse my mom and I</p>
<p>live in quaint, but the truth is, there’s nothing quaint about the</p>
<p>mile-long jog to the nearest neighbors. And unless quaint is</p>
<p>synonymous with eighteenth-century drafty money pit situated in</p>
<p>the eye of an atmospheric inversion that sucks in all the fog</p>
<p>from here to the coast, I beg to differ.</p>
<p>At the corner of Hawthorne and Beech, I saw signs of life as</p>
<p>cars zipped along on their morning commute. I used one hand</p>
<p>to stick my thumb in the air and the other to unwrap a piece of</p>
<p>breath-freshening, toothpaste-replacing gum.</p>
<p>A red Toyota 4Runner braked at the curb, and the passenger</p>
<p>window lowered with an automated hum. Marcie Millar sat</p>
<p>behind the wheel. “Car trouble?” she asked.</p>
<p>Car trouble as in no car. Not that I was about to admit it to</p>
<p>Marcie.</p>
<p>“Need a ride?” she rephrased impatiently when I failed to</p>
<p>answer.</p>
<p>I couldn’t believe out of all the cars passing down this stretch</p>
<p>of road, Marcie’s had to be the one to stop. Did I want to ride</p>
<p>with Marcie? No. Was I still worked up over what she’d said</p>
<p>about my dad? Yes. Was I about to forgive her? Absolutely not. I</p>
<p>would have gestured for her to keep driving, but there was one</p>
<p>small snag. Rumor had it that the only thing Mr. Loucks liked</p>
<p>more than the periodic table of the elements was handing out</p>
<p>detention slips to tardy students.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” I accepted reluctantly. “I’m on my way to school.”</p>
<p>“Guess your fat friend couldn’t give you a ride?”</p>
<p>I froze with my hand on the door handle. Vee and I had long</p>
<p>ago given up educating small-minded people that “fat” and</p>
<p>“curvy” are not the same thing, but that didn’t mean we tolerated</p>
<p>the ignorance. And Iwould have gladly called Vee for a ride, but</p>
<p>she’d been invited to attend a training meeting for hopeful</p>
<p>editors of the school’s eZine and was already at school.</p>
<p>“On second thought, I’ll walk.” I gave Marcie’s door a shove,</p>
<p>locking it back in position.</p>
<p>Marcie tried on a confused face. “Are you offended I called</p>
<p>her fat? Because it’s true. What is it with you? I feel like</p>
<p>everything I say has to be censored. First your dad, now this. What happened to freedom of speech?”</p>
<p>For a split moment I thought it would be nice and convenient</p>
<p>if I still had the Spider. Not only would I not be stranded without a</p>
<p>ride, but I might get the pleasure of plowing Marcie over. The</p>
<p>school parking lot was chaotic after school. Accidents</p>
<p>happened.</p>
<p>Since I couldn’t bounce Marcie off my front fender, I did the</p>
<p>Since I couldn’t bounce Marcie off my front fender, I did the</p>
<p>next best thing. “If my dad owned the Toyota dealership, I think</p>
<p>I’d be environmentally minded enough to ask for a hybrid.”</p>
<p>“Well, your dad doesn’t own the Toyota dealership.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. My dad’s dead.”</p>
<p>She raised one shoulder. “You said it, not me.”</p>
<p>“From now on, I think it’s better if we stay out of each other’s</p>
<p>way.”</p>
<p>She examined her manicure. “Fine.”</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>“Just trying to be nice, and look where it got me,” she said</p>
<p>under her breath.</p>
<p>“Nice? You called Vee fat.”</p>
<p>“I also offered you a ride.” She floored the gas, her tires</p>
<p>spitting up road dust that wafted in my direction.</p>
<p>I hadn’t woken up this morning looking for another reason to</p>
<p>hate Marcie Millar, but there you go.</p>
<p>Coldwater High had been erected in the late nineteenth century,</p>
<p>and the construction was an eclectic mix of Gothic and</p>
<p>Victorian that looked more cathedral than academic. The</p>
<p>windows were narrow and arched, the glass leaded. The stone</p>
<p>was multicolored, but mostly gray. In the summer, ivy crawled up</p>
<p>the exterior and gave the school a certain New England charm.</p>
<p>In the winter, the ivy resembled long skeletal fingers choking the</p>
<p>building.</p>
<p>I was half speed-walking, half jogging down the hall to</p>
<p>chemistry when my cell phone rang in my pocket.</p>
<p>“Mom?” I answered, not slowing my pace. “Can I call you</p>
<p>ba—”</p>
<p>“You’ll never guess who I ran into last night! Lynn Parnell. You</p>
<p>remember the Parnells. Scott’s mom.”</p>
<p>I peeked at the clock on my cell. I’d been fortunate enough to</p>
<p>hitch a ride to school with a complete stranger—a woman on</p>
<p>her way to kickboxing at the gym—but I was still cutting it short.</p>
<p>Less than two minutes to the tardy bell. “Mom? School is about</p>
<p>to start. Can I call you at lunch?”</p>
<p>“You and Scott were such good friends.”</p>
<p>She’d triggered a faint memory. “When we were five,” I said.</p>
<p>“Didn’t he always wet his pants?”</p>
<p>“I had drinks with Lynn last night. She just finalized her</p>
<p>divorce, and she and Scott are moving back to Coldwater.”</p>
<p>“That’s great. I’ll call you—”</p>
<p>“I invited them over for dinner tonight.”</p>
<p>As I passed the principal’s office, the minute hand on the</p>
<p>clock above her door ticked to the next notch. From where I</p>
<p>stood, it looked caught between 7:59 and eight sharp. I aimed a</p>
<p>threatening look at it that said Don’t you dare ring early.</p>
<p>“Tonight’s not good, Mom. Patch and I—”</p>
<p>“Don’t be silly!” Mom cut across me. “Scott is one of your</p>
<p>oldest friends in the world. You knew him long before Patch.”</p>
<p>“Scott used to force me to eat roly-polies,” I said, my memory</p>
<p>starting to come around.</p>
<p>“And you never forced him to play Barbies?”</p>
<p>“Totally different!”</p>
<p>“Tonight, seven o’clock,” Mom said in a voice that shut out all</p>
<p>argument.</p>
<p>I hurried into chemistry with seconds to spare and slid onto a</p>
<p>metal stool behind a black granite lab table on the front row.</p>
<p>Seating was two to a table, and I had my fingers crossed that I’d</p>
<p>g e t paired with someone whose understanding of science</p>
<p>surpassed my own, which, given my standard, wasn’t hard to</p>
<p>beat. I tended to be more of a romantic than a realist, and</p>
<p>chose blind faith over cold logic. Which put science and me at</p>
<p>odds right from the start.</p>
<p>Marcie Millar strolled into the room wearing heels, jeans, and</p>
<p>a silk top from Banana Republic that I had on my back-to-school</p>
<p>wish list. By Labor Day, the shirt would be on the clearance rack</p>
<p>and in my price range. I was in the process of mentally wiping</p>
<p>the shirt off the list when Marcie settled onto the stool beside</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>“What’s up with your hair?” she said. “Ran out of mousse?</p>
<p>Patience?” A smile lifted one side of her mouth. “Or is it</p>
<p>because you had to run four miles to get here on time?”</p>
<p>“What happened to staying out of each other’s way?” I gave</p>
<p>a pointed look at her stool, then mine, communicating that</p>
<p>twenty-four inches wasn’t staying out of the way.</p>
<p>“I need something from you.”</p>
<p>I exhaled silently, stabilizing my blood pressure. I should have</p>
<p>known. “Here’s the thing, Marcie,” I said. “We both know this</p>
<p>class is going to be insanely hard. Let me do you a favor and</p>
<p>warn you that science is my worst subject. The only reason I’m</p>
<p>doing summer school is because I heard chemistry is easier</p>
<p>doing summer school is because I heard chemistry is easier</p>
<p>this term. You don’t want me as a partner. This won’t be an easy</p>
<p>A.”</p>
<p>“Do I look like I’m sitting beside you for the health of my</p>
<p>GPA?” she said with an impatient flip of her wrist. “I need you</p>
<p>for something else. Last week I got a job.”</p>
<p>Marcie? A job?</p>
<p>She smirked, and I could only imagine she’d pulled my</p>
<p>thoughts directly off my expression. “I file in the front office. One</p>
<p>of my dad’s salesmen is married to the front office secretary.</p>
<p>Never hurts to have connections. Not that you’d know anything</p>
<p>about it.”</p>
<p>I’d known Marcie’s dad was influential in Coldwater. In fact,</p>
<p>he was such a large booster club donor, he had a say in every</p>
<p>coaching position at the high school, but this was ridiculous.</p>
<p>“Once in a while, a file falls open and I can’t help but see</p>
<p>things,” Marcie said.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>“For example, I know you’re still not over your dad’s death.</p>
<p>You’ve been in counseling with the school psych. In fact, I know</p>
<p>everything about everyone. Except Patch. Last week I noticed</p>
<p>his file is empty. I want to know why. I want to know what he’s</p>
<p>hiding.”</p>
<p>“Why do you care?”</p>
<p>“He was standing in my driveway last night, staring at my</p>
<p>bedroom window.”</p>
<p>I blinked. “Patch was standing in your driveway?”</p>
<p>“Unless you know some other guy who drives a Jeep</p>
<p>Commander, dresses in all black, and is superhot.”</p>
<p>I frowned. “Did he say anything?”</p>
<p>“He saw me watching from the window and left. Should I be</p>
<p>thinking about a restraining order? Is this typical behavior for</p>
<p>him? I know he’s off, but just how off are we talking?”</p>
<p>I ignored her, too absorbed with turning over this information.</p>
<p>Patch? At Marcie’s? It had to have been after he left my place.</p>
<p>After I said, “I love you,” and he bailed.</p>
<p>“No problem,” Marcie said, straightening up. “There are other</p>
<p>ways to get information, like administration. I’m guessing they’d</p>
<p>be all over an empty school file. I wasn’t going to say anything,</p>
<p>but for my own safety …”</p>
<p>I wasn’t worried about Marcie going to administration. Patch</p>
<p>could handle himself. Iwas worried about last night. Patch had</p>
<p>left abruptly, claiming he had something he needed to do, but I</p>
<p>was having a hard time believing that something was hanging</p>
<p>out in Marcie’s driveway. It was a lot easier to accept that he’d</p>
<p>left because of what I’d said.</p>
<p>“Or the police,” Marcie added, tapping her fingertip to her lip.</p>
<p>“An empty school file almost sounds illegal. How did Patch get</p>
<p>into school? You look upset, Nora. Am I onto something?” A</p>
<p>smile of surprised pleasure dawned on her face. “I am, aren’t I?</p>
<p>There’s more to the story.”</p>
<p>I settled cool eyes on her. “For someone who’s made it clear</p>
<p>that her life is superior to every other student’s at this school,</p>
<p>you sure make it a habit of pursuing every facet of our boring,</p>
<p>worthless lives.”</p>
<p>Marcie’s smile vanished. “I wouldn’t have to if you all would</p>
<p>stay out of my way.”</p>
<p>“Your way? This isn’t your school.”</p>
<p>“Don’t talk to me that way,” Marcie said with a disbelieving,</p>
<p>almost involuntary tic of her head. “In fact, don’t talk to me at all.”</p>
<p>I flipped my palms up. “No problem.”</p>
<p>“And while you’re at it, move.”</p>
<p>I glanced down at my stool, thinking surely she couldn’t</p>
<p>mean— “Iwas here first.”</p>
<p>Mimicking me, Marcie flipped her palms up. “Not my</p>
<p>problem.”</p>
<p>“I’m not moving.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sitting by you.”</p>
<p>“I’m happy to hear it.”</p>
<p>“Move,” Marcie commanded.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>The bell cut across us, and when the shrill sound of it died,</p>
<p>both Marcie and I seemed to have realized the room had grown</p>
<p>quiet. We glanced around, and it hit me with a souring to my</p>
<p>stomach that every other seat in the room was taken.</p>
<p>Mr. Loucks positioned himself in the aisle to my right, waving</p>
<p>a sheet of paper.</p>
<p>“I’m holding a blank seating chart,” he said. “Each of the</p>
<p>rectangles corresponds to a desk in the room. Write your name</p>
<p>in the appropriate rectangle and pass it on.” He slapped the</p>
<p>chart down in front of me. “Hope you like your partners,” he told</p>
<p>us. “You’ve got eight weeks with them.”</p>
<p>At noon, when class ended, I caught a ride with Vee to Enzo’s</p>
<p>Bistro, our favorite place to grab iced mochas or steamed milk,</p>
<p>depending on the season. I felt the sun bake my face as we</p>
<p>crossed the parking lot, and that’s when I saw it. A white</p>
<p>convertible Volkswagen Cabriolet with a sale sign taped in the</p>
<p>window: $1,000 OBO.</p>
<p>“You’re drooling,” Vee said, using her finger to tip my chin</p>
<p>closed.</p>
<p>“You don’t happen to have a thousand dollars I can borrow?”</p>
<p>“I don’t have five you can borrow. My piggy bank is officially</p>
<p>anorexic.”</p>
<p>I gave a sigh of longing in the direction of the Cabriolet. “I</p>
<p>need money. I need a job.” I shut my eyes, envisioning myself</p>
<p>behind the wheel of the Cabriolet, the top down, the wind</p>
<p>swishing my curly hair. With the Cabriolet, I’d never have to bum</p>
<p>a ride again. I’d be free to go where Iwanted, when I pleased.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but getting a job means you actually have to work. I</p>
<p>mean, are you sure you want to blow the entire summer laboring</p>
<p>away at minimum wage? You might, I don’t know, break a sweat</p>
<p>or something.”</p>
<p>I dug through my backpack for a scrap of paper and</p>
<p>scribbled down the number listed on the sign. Maybe I could talk</p>
<p>the owner down a couple hundred. In the meantime, I added</p>
<p>browsing the classifieds for part-time employment to my</p>
<p>afternoon to-do list. A job meant time away from Patch, but it</p>
<p>also meant private transportation. Much as I loved Patch, he</p>
<p>always seemed to be busy … doing something. Which made</p>
<p>him unreliable when it came to rides.</p>
<p>Inside Enzo’s, Vee and I placed orders for iced mochas and</p>
<p>spicy pecan salads, and plopped down with our food at a table.</p>
<p>Over the past several weeks, Enzo’s had undergone extensive</p>
<p>remodeling to bring it up to speed with the twenty-first century,</p>
<p>and Coldwater now had its very first Internet lounge. Given the</p>
<p>fact that my home computer was six years old, I was actually</p>
<p>excited about this.</p>
<p>“I don’t know about you, but I’m ready for vacation,” Vee said,</p>
<p>pushing her sunglasses to the top of her head. “Eight more</p>
<p>weeks of Spanish. That’s more days than I want to think about. What we need is a distraction. We need something that will</p>
<p>take our minds off this endless stretch of quality education</p>
<p>spread out before us. We need to go shopping. Portland, here</p>
<p>we come. Macy’s is having a big sale. I need shoes, I need</p>
<p>dresses, and I need a new fragrance.”</p>
<p>“You just bought new clothes. Two hundred dollars’ worth.</p>
<p>Your mom is going to hemorrhage when she gets her</p>
<p>MasterCard statement.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but I need a boyfriend. And to get a boyfriend, you</p>
<p>have to look good. Doesn’t hurt to smell good too.”</p>
<p>I bit a diced pear off my fork. “Have anybody in mind?”</p>
<p>“As a matter of fact, I do.”</p>
<p>“As a matter of fact, I do.”</p>
<p>“Just promise me it’s not Scott Parnell.”</p>
<p>“Scott who?”</p>
<p>I smiled. “See? Now I’m happy.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know about any Scott Parnells, but the guy I’ve got my</p>
<p>eye on happens to be hot. Off-the-charts hot. Hotter-than-Patch</p>
<p>hot.” She paused. “Well, maybe not that hot. Nobody’s that hot.</p>
<p>Seriously, the rest of my day is a wash. Portland or bust, I say.”</p>
<p>I opened my mouth, but Vee was faster.</p>
<p>“Uh-oh,” she said. “I know that look. You’re going to tell me</p>
<p>you already have plans.”</p>
<p>“Rewind to Scott Parnell. He used to live here when we were</p>
<p>five.”</p>
<p>Vee looked like she was searching her long-term memory.</p>
<p>“He wet his pants a lot,” I offered helpfully.</p>
<p>Vee’s eyes lit up. “Scotty the Potty?”</p>
<p>“He’s moving back to Coldwater. My mom invited him over</p>
<p>for dinner tonight.”</p>
<p>“I see where this is going,” Vee said, nodding sagely. “This is</p>
<p>what’s called the ‘meet cute.’ This is when the lives of two</p>
<p>potential romantic partners intersect. Remember when Desi</p>
<p>accidentally walked into the men’s room and caught Ernesto at</p>
<p>the urinal?”</p>
<p>I stopped with my fork halfway between my plate and my</p>
<p>mouth. “What?”</p>
<p>“On Corazón, the Spanish soap. No? Never mind. Your mom</p>
<p>wants to hook you and Scotty the Potty up. Pronto.”</p>
<p>“No, she doesn’t. She knows I’m with Patch.”</p>
<p>“Just because she knows, doesn’t mean she’s happy about</p>
<p>it. Your mom is going to spend a lot of time and energy turning</p>
<p>this equation from Nora plus Patch equals love, to Nora plus</p>
<p>Scotty the Potty equals love. And what about this? Maybe</p>
<p>Scotty the Potty turned into Scotty the Hottie. Have you thought</p>
<p>about that?”</p>
<p>I hadn’t, and I wasn’t going to either. I had Patch, and I was</p>
<p>perfectly happy to keep it that way.</p>
<p>“Can we talk about something slightly more urgent?” I asked,</p>
<p>thinking it was time to change the subject before our current one</p>
<p>gave Vee even more wild ideas. “Like the fact that my new</p>
<p>chemistry partner is Marcie Millar?”</p>
<p>“The ho.”</p>
<p>“Apparently she’s filing for the front office, and she looked in</p>
<p>Patch’s file.”</p>
<p>“Is it still empty?”</p>
<p>“It looks that way, since she wants me to tell her everything I</p>
<p>know about him.” Including why he was hanging out in her</p>
<p>driveway last night, gazing at her bedroom window. I’d once</p>
<p>heard a rumor that Marcie propped a tennis racket in her</p>
<p>window when she was open to payment for certain “services,”</p>
<p>but Iwasn’t going to think about that. Weren’t rumors 90 percent</p>
<p>fiction, anyway?</p>
<p>Vee leaned in closer. “What do you know?”</p>
<p>Our conversation lapsed into an uncomfortable silence. I</p>
<p>didn’t believe in secrets between best friends. But there are</p>
<p>secrets … and there are hard truths. Scary truths.</p>
<p>Unimaginable truths. Having a boyfriend who’s a fallen-turnedguardian</p>
<p>angel fits into all of the above.</p>
<p>“You’re keeping something from me,” said Vee.</p>
<p>“Am not.”</p>
<p>“Are too.”</p>
<p>Thick silence.</p>
<p>“I told Patch I loved him.”</p>
<p>Vee covered her mouth, but I couldn’t tell if she was stifling a</p>
<p>gasp or laughter. Which only made me feel more insecure. Was</p>
<p>it that funny? Had I done something even stupider than I already</p>
<p>thought?</p>
<p>“What did he say?” Vee asked.</p>
<p>Imerely looked at her.</p>
<p>“That bad?” she asked.</p>
<p>I cleared my voice. “Tell me about this guy you’re after. I</p>
<p>mean, is this a lust-from-afar thing, or have you actually talked to</p>
<p>him?”</p>
<p>Vee took the hint. “Talked to him? I had hot dogs at Skippy’s</p>
<p>with him yesterday for lunch. It was one of those blind date</p>
<p>things, and it turned out better than expected. Much better. FYI,</p>
<p>you’d know all this stuff if you returned my calls instead of</p>
<p>making out with your boyfriend nonstop.”</p>
<p>“Vee, I’m your only friend, and it wasn’t me who hooked you</p>
<p>up.”</p>
<p>“I know. Your boyfriend did.”</p>
<p>I choked on a Gorgonzola cheese ball. “Patch set you up on</p>
<p>a blind date?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, so?” Vee said, her tone edging toward defensive.</p>
<p>I smiled. “I thought you didn’t trust Patch.”</p>
<p>“I don’t.”</p>
<p>“But?”</p>
<p>“I tried calling you to vet my date first, but to repeat, you never</p>
<p>return my calls anymore.”</p>
<p>“Mission accomplished. I feel like the worst friend ever.” I</p>
<p>gave her a conspirator’s smile. “Now tell me the rest.”</p>
<p>Vee’s resistant tone dropped away, and she mirrored my</p>
<p>smile. “His name is Rixon, and he’s Irish. His brogue or</p>
<p>whatever it’s called kills me. Sexy to the max. He’s a little on the</p>
<p>skinny side considering I’m big-boned, but I’m planning on</p>
<p>losing twenty pounds this summer, so everything should even</p>
<p>out byAugust.”</p>
<p>“Rixon? No way! I love Rixon!” As a standard rule, I didn’t</p>
<p>trust fallen angels, but Rixon was an exception. Like Patch, his</p>
<p>moral boundaries were drawn in the gray area between black</p>
<p>and white. He wasn’t perfect, but he wasn’t all bad, either.</p>
<p>I grinned, pointing my fork at Vee. “I can’t believe you went</p>
<p>out with him. Imean, he’s Patch’s best friend. You hate Patch.”</p>
<p>Vee gave me her black-cat look, her hair practically bristling.</p>
<p>“Best friends doesn’t mean anything. Look at you and me. We’re nothing alike.”</p>
<p>“This is great. The four of us can hang out all summer.”</p>
<p>“Uh-uh. No way. I’m not hanging out with that whack-job</p>
<p>boyfriend of yours. I don’t care what you told me, I still think he</p>
<p>had something to do with Jules’s mysterious death in the gym.”</p>
<p>A dark cloud fell on the conversation. There had been only</p>
<p>three people in the gym the night Jules died, and I was one of</p>
<p>them. I’d never told Vee everything that happened, just enough</p>
<p>to get her to stop pressing, and for her own safety, I planned on</p>
<p>keeping it that way.</p>
<p>Vee and I spent the day driving around, picking up employment</p>
<p>applications from local fast-food joints, and it was nearly six</p>
<p>thirty when I got home. I dropped my keys on the sideboard and</p>
<p>checked the answering machine for messages. There was one</p>
<p>from my mom. She was at Michaud’s Market picking up garlic</p>
<p>bread, deli lasagna, and cheap wine, and swore on her grave</p>
<p>she would beat the Parnells to the house.</p>
<p>I deleted the message and climbed upstairs to my bedroom.</p>
<p>Since I’d missed my morning shower, and my hair had frizzed to</p>
<p>maximum height during the day, I figured I’d change into clean</p>
<p>clothes by way of damage control. Every single memory I had of</p>
<p>Scott Parnell was unpleasant, but company was company. I had</p>
<p>my cardigan halfway unbuttoned when there was a rap at the</p>
<p>front door.</p>
<p>I found Patch on the other side of it, hands in his pockets.</p>
<p>Normally I would have greeted him by bounding straight into</p>
<p>his arms. Today I held back. Last night I’d said I loved him, and</p>
<p>he’d bolted and allegedly headed straight for Marcie’s house.</p>
<p>My mood fell somewhere between injured pride, anger, and</p>
<p>insecurity. I hoped my reserved silence sent him a message</p>
<p>that something was off, and would be until he made a move to</p>
<p>correct it, either by apology or explanation.</p>
<p>“Hey,” I said, assuming casualness. “You forgot to call last</p>
<p>night. Where did you end up going?”</p>
<p>“Around. You going to invite me in?”</p>
<p>I didn’t. “I’m glad to hear Marcie’s house is just, you know,</p>
<p>around.”</p>
<p>A momentary flick of surprise in his eyes confirmed what I</p>
<p>didn’t want to believe: Marcie had been telling the truth.</p>
<p>“Want to tell me what’s going on?” I said in a slightly more</p>
<p>hostile tone. “Want to tell me what you were doing at her place</p>
<p>last night?”</p>
<p>“You sound jealous, Angel.” There might have been a note of</p>
<p>teasing behind it, but unlike usual, there was nothing</p>
<p>affectionate or playful about it.</p>
<p>“Maybe Iwouldn’t be jealous if you didn’t give me a reason to</p>
<p>be,” I shot back. “What were you doing at her house?”</p>
<p>“Taking care of business.”</p>
<p>I swept my eyebrows up. “I didn’t realize you and Marcie had</p>
<p>business.”</p>
<p>“We do, but it’s just that. Business.”</p>
<p>“Care to elaborate?” There was a heavy dose of allegation</p>
<p>crammed between my actual words.</p>
<p>“Are you accusing me of something?”</p>
<p>“Should I be?”</p>
<p>Patch was usually expert at hiding his emotions, but the line</p>
<p>of his mouth tightened. “No.”</p>
<p>“If being at her house last night was so innocent, why are you</p>
<p>having such a hard time explaining what you were doing there?”</p>
<p>having such a hard time explaining what you were doing there?”</p>
<p>“I’m not having a hard time,” he said, each word carefully</p>
<p>measured. “I’m not telling you, because what I was doing at</p>
<p>Marcie’s has nothing to do with us.”</p>
<p>How could he think this didn’t have anything to do with us?</p>
<p>Marcie was the one person who took every opportunity to attack</p>
<p>and belittle me. Over the past eleven years, she’d teased me,</p>
<p>spread horrible rumors about me, and humiliated me publicly.</p>
<p>How could he think this wasn’t personal? How could he think I’d</p>
<p>just accept this, no questions asked? Above all, couldn’t he see</p>
<p>I was terrified that Marcie would use him to hurt me? If she</p>
<p>suspected he was even remotely interested, she’d do</p>
<p>everything in her power to steal him for herself. I couldn’t stand</p>
<p>the thought of losing Patch, but it would kill me if I lost him to her.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed by that sudden fear, I said, “Don’t come back</p>
<p>until you’re ready to tell me what you were doing at her place.”</p>
<p>Patch impatiently pushed his way inside and closed the door</p>
<p>behind him. “I didn’t come here to argue. I wanted to let you</p>
<p>know Marcie ran into some trouble this afternoon.”</p>
<p>Marcie again? Did he think he hadn’t dug a deep enough</p>
<p>hole already? I tried to stay calm long enough to hear him out,</p>
<p>but Iwanted to yell across him. “Oh?” I said coolly.</p>
<p>“She was caught in the crossfire when a group of fallen</p>
<p>angels tried to force a Nephil to swear fealty inside the men’s</p>
<p>room at Bo’s Arcade. The Nephil wasn’t sixteen, so they</p>
<p>couldn’t force him, but they had fun trying. They cut him up pretty</p>
<p>bad, and broke a few ribs. Enter Marcie. She’d had too much to</p>
<p>drink and walked into the wrong restroom. The fallen angel</p>
<p>standing guard pulled a knife on her. She’s at the hospital, but</p>
<p>they’ll release her soon. Flesh wound.”</p>
<p>My pulse jumped, and I knew I was upset that Marcie had</p>
<p>been knifed, but that was the last thing I wanted to reveal to</p>
<p>Patch. I crossed my arms stiffly. “Gee, is the Nephil okay?” I</p>
<p>vaguely remembered Patch explaining, some time ago, that</p>
<p>fallen angels can’t force Nephilim to swear fealty until they’re</p>
<p>sixteen. Likewise, he couldn’t sacrifice me to get a human body</p>
<p>of his own until I turned sixteen. Sixteen was a darkly magical,</p>
<p>even crucial age in the world of angels and Nephilim.</p>
<p>Patch gave me a look that held the tiniest glare of disgust.</p>
<p>“Marcie may have been drunk, but chances are she remembers</p>
<p>what she saw. Obviously you know fallen angels and Nephilim</p>
<p>try to stay under the radar, and someone like Marcie, with a big</p>
<p>mouth, can threaten their secrecy. The last thing they want is for</p>
<p>her to announce to the world what she saw. Our world operates</p>
<p>a lot more smoothly when humans are ignorant of it. I know the</p>
<p>fallen angels involved.” His jaw tensed. “They’ll do whatever it</p>
<p>takes to keep Marcie quiet.”</p>
<p>I felt a shiver of fear for Marcie but flushed it away. Since</p>
<p>when did Patch care one way or the other what happened to</p>
<p>Marcie? Since when was he more worried about her than me?</p>
<p>“I’m trying to feel bad,” I said, “but it sounds like you’re</p>
<p>concerned enough for the both of us.” I jerked on the doorknob</p>
<p>and held the door wide. “Maybe you should go check on</p>
<p>Marcie, see if her flesh wound is healing properly.”</p>
<p>Patch pried my hand loose and shut the door with his foot.</p>
<p>“Bigger things than you, me, and Marcie are going on.” He</p>
<p>hesitated, as if he had more to say, but closed his mouth at the</p>
<p>last moment.</p>
<p>“You, me, and Marcie? Since when did you start putting the</p>
<p>three of us in the same sentence? Since when does she mean</p>
<p>anything to you?” I snapped.</p>
<p>He cupped a hand over the back of his neck, looking very</p>
<p>much like he knew he should choose his words carefully before</p>
<p>answering.</p>
<p>“Just tell me what you’re thinking!” I blurted. “Spit it out! It’s</p>
<p>bad enough that I have no idea what you’re feeling, let alone</p>
<p>what you’re thinking!”</p>
<p>Patch looked around, as if he was wondering whether I was</p>
<p>talking to someone else. “Spit it out?” he said, his tone darkly</p>
<p>incredulous. Maybe even annoyed. “What does it look like I’m</p>
<p>trying to do? If you’d calm down, I could. Right now you’re going</p>
<p>to turn hysterical, regardless of what I say.”</p>
<p>I felt my eyes narrow. “I have a right to be angry. You won’t tell</p>
<p>me what you were doing at Marcie’s last night.”</p>
<p>Patch threw his hands up. Here we go again, the gesture</p>
<p>said.</p>
<p>“Two months ago,” I began, trying to inject pride into my voice</p>
<p>to hide the quaver in it, “Vee, my mom—everyone—warned me</p>
<p>that you were the kind of guy who sees girls as conquests. They</p>
<p>said I was just another notch on your belt, another stupid girl</p>
<p>you’d seduce for your own satisfaction. They said the moment I</p>
<p>fell in love with you was the moment you’d leave.” I swallowed</p>
<p>hard. “I need to know they weren’t right.”</p>
<p>Even though I didn’t want to recall it, the memory of last night</p>
<p>resurfaced with perfect clarity. I remembered the whole</p>
<p>humiliating scene in vivid detail. I’d said I loved him, and he’d</p>
<p>left me hanging. There were a hundred different ways to analyze</p>
<p>his silence, none of them good.</p>
<p>Patch wagged his head in disbelief. “You want me to tell you</p>
<p>they’re wrong? Because I get the feeling you aren’t going to</p>
<p>believe me, no matter what I say.” He glared at me.</p>
<p>“Are you as committed to this relationship as I am?” I couldn’t</p>
<p>not ask it. Not after watching everything come tumbling down</p>
<p>since last night. I suddenly realized I had no idea how Patch</p>
<p>really felt about me. I thought I meant everything to him, but what</p>
<p>if I’d only seen what I wanted? What if I’d grossly exaggerated</p>
<p>his feelings? I held his eyes, not about to make this easy on</p>
<p>him, not about to give him a second chance to skirt the issue. I</p>
<p>needed to know. “Do you love me?”</p>
<p>I can’t answer that, he said, startling me by speaking to my</p>
<p>thoughts. It was a gift all angels possessed, but I didn’t</p>
<p>understand why he was choosing now to use it. “I’ll stop by</p>
<p>tomorrow. Sleep well,” he added curtly, heading for the door.</p>
<p>“When we kiss, are you faking it?”</p>
<p>He stopped short. Another disbelieving shake of his head.</p>
<p>“Faking it?”</p>
<p>“When I touch you, do you feel anything? How far does your</p>
<p>desire go? Do you feel anything close to what I feel for you?”</p>
<p>Patch watched me in silence. “Nora—,” he began.</p>
<p>“Iwant a straight answer.”</p>
<p>After a moment, he said, “Emotionally, yes.”</p>
<p>“But physically no, right? How am I supposed to be in a</p>
<p>relationship, when I have no idea how much it even means to</p>
<p>you? Am I experiencing things on a whole different level?</p>
<p>Because that’s what it feels like. And I hate it,” I added. “I don’t</p>
<p>want you to kiss me because you have to. I don’t want you to</p>
<p>pretend it means something, when it’s really just an act.”</p>
<p>“Just an act? Are you listening to yourself?” He tipped his</p>
<p>head back against the wall and gave another, darker laugh. He</p>
<p>cut me a sideways glance. “Are you done with the accusations?</p>
<p>”</p>
<p>“You think this is funny?” I said, hit by a fresh wave of anger.</p>
<p>“Just the opposite.” Before I could say more, he turned</p>
<p>toward the door. “Call me when you’re ready to talk rationally.”</p>
<p>“What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>
<p>“It means you’re crazy. You’re impossible.”</p>
<p>“I’m crazy?”</p>
<p>He tipped my chin up and planted a quick, rough kiss on my</p>
<p>mouth. “And Imust be crazy for putting up with it.”</p>
<p>I pulled free and rubbed my chin resentfully. “You gave up</p>
<p>becoming human for me, and this is what I get? A boyfriend who</p>
<p>hangs out at Marcie’s, but won’t tell me why. A boyfriend who</p>
<p>walks out at the first hint of a fight. Try this on for size: You’re a —jerk!”</p>
<p>Jerk? he spoke to my thoughts, his voice cold and cutting.</p>
<p>I’m trying to follow the rules. I’m not supposed to fall in love</p>
<p>with you. We both knowthis isn’t about Marcie. This is about</p>
<p>how I feel about you. I have to hold back. I’m walking a</p>
<p>dangerous line. Falling in love is what got me in trouble in the</p>
<p>first place. I can’t be with you the way I want.</p>
<p>“Why did you give up becoming human for me if you knew</p>
<p>you couldn’t be with me?” I asked, my voice wobbling slightly,</p>
<p>sweat prickling the palms of my hands. “What did you even</p>
<p>expect from a relationship with me? What’s the point of”—my</p>
<p>voice caught and I swallowed without meaning to—“us?” What had I expected from a relationship with Patch? At some</p>
<p>point, I must have thought about where our relationship was</p>
<p>headed, and what would happen. Of course I had. But I’d been</p>
<p>so frightened by what I saw coming that I’d pretended the</p>
<p>inevitable away. I’d pretended a relationship with Patch could</p>
<p>work, because deep inside, any time with Patch had seemed</p>
<p>better than nothing at all.</p>
<p>Angel.</p>
<p>I looked up when Patch spoke my name in my thoughts.</p>
<p>Being close to you on any level is better than nothing. I’m</p>
<p>not going to lose you. He paused, and for the first time since I’d</p>
<p>know him, I saw a flicker of worry in his eyes. But I already fell</p>
<p>once. If I give the archangels cause to think I’m even remotely</p>
<p>in love with you, they’ll send me to hell. Forever.</p>
<p>The news hit me like a blow to the stomach. “What?”</p>
<p>I’m a guardian angel, or at least so I’ve been told, but the</p>
<p>archangels don’t trust me. I have no privileges, no privacy.</p>
<p>Two of them cornered me last night for a talk, and I walked</p>
<p>away with the feeling that they want me to slip up again. For</p>
<p>whatever reason, they’re choosing nowto crack down on me.</p>
<p>They’re looking for any excuse to get rid of me. I’m on</p>
<p>probation, and if I screw this up, my story doesn’t have a</p>
<p>happy ending.</p>
<p>I stared at him, thinking he had to be exaggerating, thinking it</p>
<p>couldn’t possibly be that bad, but one look at his face told me</p>
<p>he’d never been more serious.</p>
<p>“What happens now?” Iwondered out loud.</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Patch sighed with frustration. The truth</p>
<p>of the matter was, this was going to end badly. No matter how</p>
<p>much we backpedaled, stalled, or looked the other way, one</p>
<p>day all too soon, our lives would be ripped apart. What would</p>
<p>happen when I graduated and went off to college? What would</p>
<p>happen when I followed my dream job to the other side of the</p>
<p>country? What would happen when it came time for me to marry</p>
<p>or have kids? I wasn’t doing anyone a favor by falling in love</p>
<p>with Patch more every day. Did I really want to stay on this road</p>
<p>longer, knowing it was only going to end with devastation?</p>
<p>For one fleeting moment, I thought I had the answer—I’d give</p>
<p>up my dreams. It was as simple as that. I shut my eyes and let</p>
<p>go of my dreams like they were balloons on long, thin ribbons. I</p>
<p>didn’t need those dreams. I couldn’t even be sure they’d come</p>
<p>true. And even if they did, I didn’t want to spend the rest of my</p>
<p>life alone and tortured by the knowledge that everything I’d done</p>
<p>meant nothing without Patch.</p>
<p>And then it hit me in a terrible way that neither of us could</p>
<p>give up everything. My life would continue marching into the</p>
<p>future, and I didn’t have the power to stop it. Patch would stay</p>
<p>an angel forever; he would continue the path he’d been on since</p>
<p>he fell.</p>
<p>“Isn’t there anything we can do?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I’m working on it.”</p>
<p>In other words, he had nothing. We were trapped on both</p>
<p>sides—the archangels applying pressure from one direction,</p>
<p>and two futures headed in vastly different directions from the</p>
<p>other.</p>
<p>“I want out,” I said quietly. I knew I wasn’t being fair—I was</p>
<p>protecting myself. What other option did I have? I couldn’t give</p>
<p>Patch a chance to talk me out of it. I had to do what was best for</p>
<p>both of us. I couldn’t stand here, hanging on, when the very thing</p>
<p>I held disappeared more with each passing day. I couldn’t show</p>
<p>how much I cared when it was only going to make things</p>
<p>impossibly hard in the end. Most of all, I didn’t want to be the</p>
<p>reason Patch lost everything he’d worked for. If the archangels</p>
<p>were looking for an excuse to banish him forever, I was only</p>
<p>making it easy.</p>
<p>Patch stared at me like he couldn’t tell if I was serious.</p>
<p>“That’s it? You want out? You got your turn to explain yourself,</p>
<p>which I don’t buy, by the way, but now that it’s my turn, I’m</p>
<p>supposed to just swallow your decision and walk out?”</p>
<p>I hugged my elbows and turned away. “You can’t force me to</p>
<p>stay in a relationship I don’t want.”</p>
<p>“Can we talk about this?”</p>
<p>“If you want to talk, tell me what you were doing at Marcie’s</p>
<p>“If you want to talk, tell me what you were doing at Marcie’s</p>
<p>last night.” But Patch was right. This wasn’t about Marcie. This</p>
<p>was because Iwas scared and upset with the deal that fate and</p>
<p>circumstance had cut both of us.</p>
<p>I turned back to see Patch drag his hands down his face. He</p>
<p>gave a short, unamused laugh.</p>
<p>“If I’d been at Rixon’s last night, you’d wonder what was</p>
<p>going on!” I flung back.</p>
<p>“No,” he said, his voice dangerously low. “I trust you.”</p>
<p>Afraid I’d lose my resolve if I didn’t act immediately, I</p>
<p>smacked the heels of my hands against his chest, knocking him</p>
<p>back a step. “Go,” I said, tears making my voice rough. “I have</p>
<p>other things I want to do with my life. Things that don’t involve</p>
<p>you. I have college and future jobs. I’m not going to throw it all</p>
<p>away on something that was never meant to be.”</p>
<p>Patch flinched. “Is this what you really want?”</p>
<p>“When I kiss my boyfriend, Iwant to know he feels it!”</p>
<p>As soon as I said it, I regretted it. I didn’t want to hurt him—I</p>
<p>just wanted to get this moment over with as quickly as possible</p>
<p>before I unraveled and broke down sobbing. But I’d gone too</p>
<p>far. I saw him stiffen. We stood face-to-face, both of us</p>
<p>breathing hard.</p>
<p>Then he strode out, yanking the door shut behind him.</p>
<p>Once the door was closed, I collapsed against it. Tears</p>
<p>burned at the back of my eyes, but not a single drop fell. I had</p>
<p>too much frustration and anger clashing around inside me to</p>
<p>feel much of anything else, but I suspected in a way that caused</p>
<p>a sob to catch in my throat, that five minutes from now, when</p>
<p>everything else had dropped away and I realized the full impact</p>
<p>of what I’d done, I’d feel my heart breaking.</p><p>

<p></p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>I LOWERED MYSELF ONTO THE CORNER OF MY bed, staring into</p>
<p>space. The anger was beginning to wear off, but I almost</p>
<p>wished I could stay caught up in its fever forever. The emptiness</p>
<p>it left behind ached more than the sharp, fiery pain I’d felt when</p>
<p>Patch walked out. I tried to make sense of what had just</p>
<p>happened, but my thoughts were a disjointed mess. Our</p>
<p>shouted words rang in my ears, but they echoed helter-skelter,</p>
<p>like I was recalling a bad dream rather than an actual</p>
<p>conversation.</p>
<p>Had I really broken up with him? Had I really meant for it to be</p>
<p>permanent? Was there no way around fate or, more</p>
<p>immediately, the archangels’ threats? By way of an answer, my</p>
<p>stomach twisted, threatening to be sick.</p>
<p>I hurried to the bathroom and knelt over the toilet, my ears</p>
<p>clanging and my breathing coming out shallow and choppy. What had I done? Nothing permanent, definitely nothing</p>
<p>permanent. Tomorrow we’d see each other again and</p>
<p>everything would go back to the way it had been. This was just a</p>
<p>fight. A stupid fight. This wasn’t the end. Tomorrow we’d realize</p>
<p>how petty we’d been and apologize. We’d put this behind us. We’d make up.</p>
<p>I dragged myself to my feet and turned on the sink faucet. Wetting a washcloth, I pressed it to my face. My mind still felt</p>
<p>like it was unraveling faster than a spool of thread, and I</p>
<p>squeezed my eyes closed to make the motion stop. But what</p>
<p>about the archangels? I asked myself again. How could Patch</p>
<p>and I have a normal relationship when they were constantly</p>
<p>watching us? I froze. They could be watching me right now. They</p>
<p>could be watching Patch. Trying to tell if he’d crossed the line.</p>
<p>Looking for any excuse to send him to hell, and away from me,</p>
<p>forever.</p>
<p>I felt my anger reignite. Why couldn’t they leave us alone?</p>
<p>Why were they so bent on destroying Patch? Patch had told me</p>
<p>he was the first fallen angel to get his wings back and become</p>
<p>a guardian angel. Were the archangels angry over that? Did</p>
<p>they feel Patch had somehow tricked them? Or that he’d</p>
<p>cheated his way back up from the bottom? Did they want to put</p>
<p>him in his place? Or did they merely not trust him?</p>
<p>I closed my eyes, feeling a tear travel down the side of my</p>
<p>nose. I take it all back, I thought. I desperately wanted to call</p>
<p>Patch but didn’t know whether I’d be putting him at some kind of</p>
<p>risk. Could the archangels listen in on phone conversations?</p>
<p>How were Patch and I supposed to have an honest talk if they</p>
<p>were eavesdropping?</p>
<p>I also couldn’t let go of my pride that quickly. Didn’t he realize</p>
<p>he was just as much in the wrong? The whole reason we’d</p>
<p>fought in the first place was because he’d refused to tell me</p>
<p>what he was doing at Marcie’s house last night. I wasn’t the</p>
<p>jealous type, but he knew my history with Marcie. He knew this</p>
<p>was the one time when I had to know.</p>
<p>There was something else causing my insides to sicken.</p>
<p>Patch said Marcie had been attacked in the men’s room at</p>
<p>Bo’s Arcade. What was Marcie doing at Bo’s? As far as I knew,</p>
<p>nobody at Cold-water High hung out at Bo’s. In fact, prior to</p>
<p>meeting Patch, I’d never heard of the place. Was it a</p>
<p>coincidence that the day after Patch was gazing at Marcie’s</p>
<p>bedroom window, she’d wandered through Bo’s front doors?</p>
<p>Patch had insisted there was nothing but business between</p>
<p>them, but what did that even mean? And Marcie was many</p>
<p>things, among them seductive and persuasive. Not only did she</p>
<p>not take no for an answer, she didn’t accept any answer that</p>
<p>wasn’t exactly what she wanted. What if, this time, she wanted … Patch?</p>
<p>A loud rap at the front door brought me out of my reverie.</p>
<p>I curled up in the heaps of pillows on my bed, closed my</p>
<p>eyes, and dialed my mom. “The Parnells are here.”</p>
<p>“Ack! I’m at the light on Walnut. I’ll be there in two minutes.</p>
<p>Invite them in.”</p>
<p>“I barely remember Scott, and I don’t remember his mom at</p>
<p>all. I’ll invite them in, but I’m not making small talk. I’ll hang out in</p>
<p>my room until you get back.” I tried to convey in my tone that</p>
<p>something was wrong, but it wasn’t like I could confide in my</p>
<p>mom. She hated Patch. She wouldn’t sympathize. I couldn’t</p>
<p>take hearing the happiness and relief in her voice. Not now.</p>
<p>“Nora.”</p>
<p>“Fine! I’ll talk to them.” I snapped my phone shut and threw it</p>
<p>across the room.</p>
<p>I took my time walking to the front door and flipped the lock</p>
<p>back. The guy standing on the doormat was tall and well built— I</p>
<p>could tell, since his T-shirt fit on the snug side and blatantly</p>
<p>advertised PLATINUMGYM, PORTLAND. A silver hoop ran through his</p>
<p>right earlobe, and his Levi’s hung dangerously low on the hips.</p>
<p>He wore a pink Hawaiian-print ball cap that looked fresh off a</p>
<p>thrift store shelf and had to be an inside joke, and his</p>
<p>sunglasses reminded me of Hulk Hogan. Despite all this, he</p>
<p>had a certain boyish charm.</p>
<p>The corners of his mouth turned up. “You must be Nora.”</p>
<p>“You must be Scott.”</p>
<p>He stepped inside and pulled off his sunglasses. His eyes</p>
<p>scanned the hall leading back to the kitchen and family room.</p>
<p>“Where’s your mom?”</p>
<p>“On her way home with dinner.”</p>
<p>“What are we having?”</p>
<p>I didn’t like his use of the word “we.” There was no “we.”</p>
<p>There was the Grey family, and the Parnell family. Two separate</p>
<p>entities that happened to be sharing the same dinner table for</p>
<p>one night. When I didn’t answer, he pushed on. “Coldwater’s a little</p>
<p>smaller than I’m used to.”</p>
<p>I folded my arms over my chest. “It’s also a little colder than</p>
<p>Portland.”</p>
<p>He gave me a head-to-toe, then smiled ever so slightly. “So I</p>
<p>noticed.” He sidestepped me on his way to the kitchen and</p>
<p>noticed.” He sidestepped me on his way to the kitchen and</p>
<p>tugged on the fridge door. “Got any beer?”</p>
<p>“What? No.”</p>
<p>The front door was still open, and voices carried in from</p>
<p>outside. My mom stepped over the threshold, carrying two</p>
<p>brown paper grocery bags. A round woman with a bad pixiestyle</p>
<p>haircut and heavy pink makeup followed her in.</p>
<p>“Nora, this is Lynn Parnell,” my mom said. “Lynn, this is Nora.</p>
<p>”</p>
<p>“My, my,” Mrs. Parnell said, clasping her hands together.</p>
<p>“She looks just like you, doesn’t she, Blythe? And look at those</p>
<p>legs! Longer than the Vegas strip.”</p>
<p>I spoke up. “I know this is bad timing, but I’m not feeling well,</p>
<p>so I’m going to go lie down—”</p>
<p>I broke off at the black look my mom shot in my direction. I</p>
<p>aimed my most unjust look back.</p>
<p>“Scott has really grown up, hasn’t he, Nora?” she said.</p>
<p>“Very observant.”</p>
<p>Mom set the bags on the counter and addressed Scott.</p>
<p>“Nora and I were a little nostalgic this morning, remembering all</p>
<p>the things the two of you used to do. Nora told me you used to</p>
<p>try to get her to eat roly-polies.”</p>
<p>Before Scott could defend himself, I said, “He used to fry</p>
<p>them alive under a magnifying glass, and he didn’t try to get me</p>
<p>to eat them. He sat on top of me and pinched my nose until I ran</p>
<p>out of air and had to open my mouth. Then he flicked them</p>
<p>inside.”</p>
<p>Mom and Mrs. Parnell shared a quick look.</p>
<p>“Scott was always very persuasive,” Mrs. Parnell said</p>
<p>quickly. “He can talk people into doing things they’d never</p>
<p>dream of. He has a knack for it. He talked me into buying him a</p>
<p>1966 Ford Mustang, mint condition. Of course, he hit me at a</p>
<p>good time, I was so guilt-ridden over the divorce. Well. As I was</p>
<p>saying, Scott probably made the best fried roly-polies on the</p>
<p>whole block.”</p>
<p>Everyone looked to me for confirmation.</p>
<p>I couldn’t believe we were discussing this as if it was a</p>
<p>perfectly normal topic of conversation.</p>
<p>“So,” Scott piped up, scratching his chest. His bicep flexed</p>
<p>when he did, but he probably knew that. “What’s for dinner?”</p>
<p>“Lasagna, garlic bread, and a Jell-O salad,” said Mom with a</p>
<p>smile. “Nora made the salad.”</p>
<p>This was news to me. “I did?”</p>
<p>“You bought the Jell-O boxes,” she reminded me.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t really count.”</p>
<p>“Nora made the salad,” Mom assured Scott. “I think</p>
<p>everything is ready. Why don’t we eat?”</p>
<p>Once seated, we joined hands and Mom blessed the food.</p>
<p>“Tell me about apartments in the neighborhood,” Mrs. Parnell</p>
<p>said, cutting the lasagna and sliding the first piece onto Scott’s</p>
<p>plate. “How much can I expect to pay for two bedrooms, two</p>
<p>baths?”</p>
<p>“Depends how remodeled you want,” Mom answered.</p>
<p>“Almost everything on this side of town was built pre-1900, and</p>
<p>it shows. When we were first married, Harrison and I looked at</p>
<p>several inexpensive two-bedroom apartments, but there was</p>
<p>several inexpensive two-bedroom apartments, but there was</p>
<p>always something wrong—holes in the walls, cockroach</p>
<p>problems, or they weren’t within walking distance of a park.</p>
<p>Since I was pregnant, we decided we needed a bigger place.</p>
<p>This house had been on the market for eighteen months, and</p>
<p>we were able to get a deal we considered almost too good to</p>
<p>be true.” She looked around. “Harrison and I had planned on</p>
<p>fully restoring it eventually, but … well, and then … as you know …” She bowed her head.</p>
<p>Scott cleared his throat. “Sorry about your dad, Nora. I still</p>
<p>remember my dad calling me the night it happened. I was</p>
<p>working a few blocks away at a convenience store. I hope they</p>
<p>catch whoever killed him.”</p>
<p>I tried to say thank you, but the words had broken to pieces in</p>
<p>my throat. I didn’t want to talk about my dad. The raw feelings</p>
<p>from my breakup with Patch were enough to deal with. Where</p>
<p>was he right now? Was regret eating at him? Did he understand</p>
<p>how much I wanted to take back everything I’d said? I suddenly</p>
<p>wondered if he’d texted me, and wished I’d brought my phone</p>
<p>down to the dinner table. But how much could he even say?</p>
<p>Could the archangels read his texts? How much could they</p>
<p>see? Were they everywhere? I wondered, feeling very</p>
<p>vulnerable.</p>
<p>“Tell us, Nora,” Mrs. Parnell said. “What’s Coldwater High</p>
<p>like? Scott wrestled back in Portland. His team won State the</p>
<p>last three years. Is the wrestling team here any good? I was</p>
<p>sure we’d faced off against Coldwater before, but then Scott</p>
<p>reminded me Coldwater is Class C.”</p>
<p>Iwas slow to pull myself out of the fog of my thoughts. Did we</p>
<p>even have a wrestling team?</p>
<p>“I don’t know about wrestling,” I said flatly, “but the basketball</p>
<p>team went to State once.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Parnell choked on her wine. “Once?” Her eyes cut</p>
<p>between me and my mom, demanding an explanation.</p>
<p>“There’s a team picture across from the front office,” I said.</p>
<p>“From the look of the picture, it was over sixty years ago.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Parnell’s eyes stretched. “Sixty years ago?” She</p>
<p>dabbed her mouth with her napkin. “Is there something wrong</p>
<p>with the school? The coach? The athletic director?”</p>
<p>“No biggie,” Scott said. “I’m taking the year off.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Parnell set down her fork with a loud chink. “But you</p>
<p>love wrestling.”</p>
<p>Scott shoveled in another bite of lasagna and raised an</p>
<p>indifferent shoulder.</p>
<p>“And it’s your senior year.”</p>
<p>“So?” Scott said around his food.</p>
<p>Mrs. Parnell planted her elbows on the table and leaned in.</p>
<p>“So you’re not getting into college on your grades, mister. Your</p>
<p>only hope this late in the game is that a community college</p>
<p>picks you up.”</p>
<p>“I’ve got other stuff Iwant to do.”</p>
<p>Her eyebrows shot up. “Oh? Like repeat last year?” As soon</p>
<p>as she said it, I saw a spark of fear in her eyes.</p>
<p>Scott chewed twice more, then swallowed hard. “Pass the</p>
<p>salad, Blythe?”</p>
<p>My mom handed the bowl of Jell-O to Mrs. Parnell, who set it</p>
<p>down in front of Scott a little too carefully.</p>
<p>“What happened last year?” my mom asked, filling the tense</p>
<p>silence.</p>
<p>Mrs. Parnell waved a dismissive hand. “Oh, you know how it</p>
<p>is. Scott got into a bit of trouble, usual stuff. Nothing every</p>
<p>mother of a teenage boy hasn’t seen before.” She laughed, but</p>
<p>her pitch was off.</p>
<p>“Mom,” Scott said in a tone that sounded a lot like a warning.</p>
<p>“You know how boys are,” Mrs. Parnell prattled on, gesturing</p>
<p>with her fork. “They don’t think. They live in the moment. They’re</p>
<p>reckless. Be glad you have a daughter, Blythe. Oh, my. That</p>
<p>garlic bread is making my mouth water—pass a slice?”</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t have said anything,” my mom murmured, passing</p>
<p>the bread. “I can’t say enough how delighted we are to have you</p>
<p>back in Coldwater.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Parnell nodded vigorously. “We’re just glad to be back,</p>
<p>and all in one piece.”</p>
<p>I’d paused eating, dividing glances between Scott and Mrs.</p>
<p>Parnell, trying to figure out what was going on. Boys will be</p>
<p>boys, that much I could buy. What I wasn’t buying was Mrs.</p>
<p>Parnell’s anxious insistence that her son’s trouble fell into the</p>
<p>category of typical. And Scott’s close supervision of every word</p>
<p>that fell from her mouth wasn’t helping to change my mind.</p>
<p>Thinking there was more to the story than they were saying, I</p>
<p>pressed a hand to my heart and said, “Why, Scott, you didn’t go</p>
<p>around at night stealing road signs to hang in your bedroom,</p>
<p>did you?”</p>
<p>did you?”</p>
<p>Mrs. Parnell erupted into genuine, almost relieved, laughter.</p>
<p>Bingo. Whatever trouble Scott had wormed his way into, it</p>
<p>wasn’t something as harmless as stealing road signs. I didn’t</p>
<p>have fifty dollars, but if I did, I would have bet it all on the hunch</p>
<p>that Scott’s trouble was anything but the usual stuff.</p>
<p>“Well,” my mom said, her smile pinched at the corners, “I’m</p>
<p>sure whatever happened is in the past. Coldwater is a great</p>
<p>place for a fresh start. Have you registered for classes yet,</p>
<p>Scott? Some of them fill up quickly, especially the advanced</p>
<p>placement classes.”</p>
<p>“Advanced placement,” Scott repeated with an amused</p>
<p>snort. “As inAP? No offense, but I’m not aiming that high.As my</p>
<p>mom”— he reached sideways and shook her shoulder in a way</p>
<p>that was just a little too rough to be friendly— “so kindly pointed</p>
<p>out, if I go to college, it won’t be for grades.”</p>
<p>Not wanting to give anyone at the table a chance to pull us</p>
<p>further away from the topic of Scott’s former troubles, I said,</p>
<p>“Oh, come on, Scott. You’re killing me. What’s so bad about</p>
<p>your past? It can’t be so horrible that you’re not willing to tell old</p>
<p>friends.”</p>
<p>“Nora—,” my mom started.</p>
<p>“Get a few DUIs? Steal a car? Joyride?”</p>
<p>Under the table, I felt my mom’s foot come to rest on top of</p>
<p>mine. She directed a sharp look at me that said, What’s gotten</p>
<p>into you?</p>
<p>Scott’s chair scraped back against the floor, and he got to</p>
<p>his feet. “Bathroom?” he asked my mom. He stretched his</p>
<p>collar. “Indigestion.”</p>
<p>“At the top of the stairs.” Her voice was apologetic. She was</p>
<p>actually apologizing for my behavior, when she was the one</p>
<p>who’d set the whole ridiculous evening up. Anyone with a shred</p>
<p>of perceptiveness could see that the point of this dinner wasn’t</p>
<p>to share a meal with old family friends. Vee was right—this was</p>
<p>a meet cute. Well, I had news for my mom. Scott and me? Not</p>
<p>happening.</p>
<p>After Scott excused himself, Mrs. Parnell smiled wide, as if</p>
<p>to erase the past five minutes and start fresh. “So tell me,” she</p>
<p>said a little too brightly, “does Nora have a boyfriend?”</p>
<p>“No,” I said at the same time Mom said, “Sort of.”</p>
<p>“That’s confusing,” Mrs. Parnell said, chewing a forkful of</p>
<p>lasagna and looking between Mom and me.</p>
<p>“His name is Patch,” Mom said.</p>
<p>“Odd name,” mused Mrs. Parnell. “What were his parents</p>
<p>thinking?”</p>
<p>“It’s a nickname,” Mom explained. “Patch gets in a lot of</p>
<p>fights. He’s always needing to be patched up.”</p>
<p>Suddenly Iregretted ever explaining to her that Patch was his</p>
<p>nickname.</p>
<p>Mrs. Parnell shook her head. “I think it’s a gang name. All the</p>
<p>gangs use nicknames. Slasher, Slayer, Maimer, Mauler,</p>
<p>Reaper. Patch.”</p>
<p>Irolled my eyes. “Patch is not in a gang.”</p>
<p>“That’s what you think,” Mrs. Parnell said. “Gangs are for</p>
<p>inner-city criminals, right? They’re roaches that only come out at</p>
<p>night.” She grew silent, and I thought I saw her eyes flick to</p>
<p>Scott’s empty chair. “Times are changing. A couple weeks ago I</p>
<p>watched a Law& Order about a new breed of wealthy suburban</p>
<p>gangs. They called them secret societies, or blood societies, or</p>
<p>some such nonsense, but it all boils down to the same thing. I</p>
<p>thought it was your typical sensationalized Hollywood garbage,</p>
<p>but Scott’s dad said he’s seeing more of this stuff all the time.</p>
<p>He would know—him being a cop and all.”</p>
<p>“Your husband is a cop?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Ex-husband, rot his soul.”</p>
<p>That’s enough. Scott’s voice drifted out of the shadowy hall,</p>
<p>and I jumped. I was on the verge of wondering if he’d gone to</p>
<p>the bathroom at all, or if he’d stood just outside the dining room,</p>
<p>eavesdropping, when it dawned on me that I didn’t think he’d</p>
<p>spoken out loud. In fact—</p>
<p>I was pretty sure he’d spoken to my … thoughts. No. Not my</p>
<p>thoughts. His mother’s.And somehow I’d overheard.</p>
<p>Mrs. Parnell flipped her palms up. “All I said was rot his</p>
<p>soul— I’m not taking that back, it’s exactly how I feel.”</p>
<p>“I said stop talking.” Scott’s voice was quiet, eerie.</p>
<p>My mom spun around, as if just now noticing that Scott had</p>
<p>entered the room. I blinked in dazed disbelief. I couldn’t really</p>
<p>have overheard him speaking to his mom’s thoughts. I mean,</p>
<p>Scott was human … wasn’t he?</p>
<p>“Is that how you talk to your own mother?” Mrs. Parnell said,</p>
<p>shaking her finger at him. But I could tell it was more for our</p>
<p>benefit than for any purpose of putting Scott in his place.</p>
<p>His cold stare stayed fixed on her a moment longer, then he</p>
<p>retreated to the front door and yanked it shut at his back.</p>
<p>Mrs. Parnell wiped her mouth, pink lipstick staining her</p>
<p>napkin. “The nasty side of divorce.” She let go of a long,</p>
<p>troubled sigh. “Scott never used to have a temper. Of course, it</p>
<p>could be that he’s growing up to be his father’s son. Well. It’s an</p>
<p>unpleasant topic and not appropriate for dinner. Does Patch</p>
<p>wrestle, Nora? I bet Scott could teach him a few things.”</p>
<p>“He plays pool,” I said, my voice uninspired; I had no desire</p>
<p>to talk about Patch. Not here, not now. Not when the subject of</p>
<p>his name had caused a rock to swell in my throat. More than</p>
<p>ever, I wished I’d brought my cell phone to the table. I wasn’t</p>
<p>feeling half so angry, which meant Patch had probably cooled</p>
<p>off too. Had he forgiven me enough to send a text or call?</p>
<p>Everything was a tangled mess, but there had to be a way</p>
<p>around it. This wasn’t as bad as it seemed. We’d find a way to</p>
<p>work it out.</p>
<p>Mrs. Parnell nodded. “Polo. Now there’s a true Maine sport.”</p>
<p>“Pool as in pool halls,” Mom corrected, sounding a little pale.</p>
<p>Mrs. Parnell cocked her head like she wasn’t sure she’d</p>
<p>heard right. “Hotbeds of gang activity,” she finally said. “The</p>
<p>Law & Order I saw? Wealthy, upper-class young men were</p>
<p>running their neighborhood pool halls like Las Vegas casinos.</p>
<p>Best keep a close eye on that Patch of yours, Nora. Could have</p>
<p>a side to him he’s keeping from you. A side he’s keeping in the</p>
<p>dark.”</p>
<p>“He’s not in a gang,” I repeated for what felt like the millionth</p>
<p>time, straining to hang on to a courteous tone.</p>
<p>But as soon as I said it, I realized I had no way of knowing for</p>
<p>certain that Patch had never been in a gang. Did a group of</p>
<p>fallen angels count as a gang? I didn’t know much about his</p>
<p>past, particularly before he met me …</p>
<p>“We’ll see,” Mrs. Parnell said, doubtful. “We’ll see.”</p>
<p>An hour later, the food was gone, the dishes were washed, Mrs.</p>
<p>Parnell had finally left to hunt down Scott, and I retreated to my</p>
<p>room. My cell was faceup on the floor, showing that I had no new</p>
<p>texts, no new messages, and no missed calls.</p>
<p>My lip quivered, and I dug the heels of my hands into my eyes</p>
<p>to stop the tears beginning to blur my vision. To keep from</p>
<p>dwelling on all the awful things I’d said to Patch, I tried to work</p>
<p>out in my mind a way to repair everything. The archangels</p>
<p>couldn’t forbid us from talking or seeing each other—not when</p>
<p>Patch was my guardian angel. He had to stay in my life. We’d</p>
<p>keep doing what we’d always done. In a couple of days, after</p>
<p>we’d shaken off our first real fight, things would go back to</p>
<p>normal. And who cared about my future? I could work everything</p>
<p>out later. It wasn’t like I had to have my whole life planned right</p>
<p>this moment.</p>
<p>But there was one thing that just wasn’t adding up. Patch and</p>
<p>I had spent the past two months displaying our affection openly,</p>
<p>with no reservations whatsoever. So why was he just now</p>
<p>showing concern over the archangels?</p>
<p>My mom poked her head inside my room. “I’m going to pick</p>
<p>up a few toiletries for my trip tomorrow. I should be back soon.</p>
<p>Need anything while I’m out?”</p>
<p>I noticed she didn’t bring up Scott as potential boyfriend</p>
<p>material. Apparently his uncertain past had withered her</p>
<p>matchmaking urges. “I’m good, but thanks anyway.”</p>
<p>She started to pull the door shut, then stopped. “We sort of</p>
<p>have a problem. I let it slip to Lynn that you don’t have a car. She</p>
<p>volunteered Scott to drive you to summer school. I told her that</p>
<p>really wouldn’t be necessary, but I think she thought I was only</p>
<p>saying no because Iwas worried we’d be putting Scott out. She</p>
<p>said you could pay him back for his time by giving him a tour of</p>
<p>Coldwater tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Vee gives me a ride to school.”</p>
<p>“I made that clear, but she’s not taking no for an answer. It</p>
<p>might be better if you explain things to Scott directly. Thank him</p>
<p>for the offer, but tell him you already have a ride.”</p>
<p>Just what Iwanted. More interaction with Scott.</p>
<p>“I’d like you to keep riding with Vee,” she added slowly. “In</p>
<p>fact, if Scott stops by while I’m out of town this week, maybe it’s</p>
<p>best to keep your distance.”</p>
<p>“You don’t trust him?”</p>
<p>“We don’t know him very well,” she said carefully.</p>
<p>“But Scott and I used to be best friends, remember?”</p>
<p>She looked at me emphatically. “That was a long time ago.</p>
<p>Things change.”</p>
<p>My point exactly.</p>
<p>“I would just like to know a bit more about Scott before you</p>
<p>go spending too much time with him,” she continued. “When I</p>
<p>go spending too much time with him,” she continued. “When I</p>
<p>get back, I’ll see what I can find out.” Well, this was an unexpected turn of events. “You’re going to</p>
<p>dig up dirt on him?”</p>
<p>“Lynn and I are good friends. She’s under a lot of stress. She</p>
<p>may need someone to confide in.” She took a step toward my</p>
<p>dresser, pumped a dot of my hand lotion into her palm, and</p>
<p>rubbed her hands together. “If she mentions Scott, well, I’m not</p>
<p>going to not listen.”</p>
<p>“If it helps build your case that he’s still up to no good, I</p>
<p>thought he acted really weird at dinner.”</p>
<p>“His parents are coming off a divorce,” she said in that same</p>
<p>carefully neutral tone. “I’m sure he’s going through a lot of</p>
<p>turmoil. It’s hard losing a parent.”</p>
<p>Tell me about it.</p>
<p>“The auction ends Wednesday afternoon, and I should be</p>
<p>home by dinner. Vee’s staying over tomorrow night, right?”</p>
<p>“Right,” I said, just now remembering I still needed to discuss</p>
<p>this with Vee, but I couldn’t imagine there’d be a problem. “By</p>
<p>the way, I’m thinking about getting a job.” Better to toss it out in</p>
<p>the open, especially since with any luck, I hoped to have</p>
<p>employment before she returned home.</p>
<p>Mom blinked. “Where did this come from?”</p>
<p>“I need a car.”</p>
<p>“I thought Vee was fine with giving you rides.”</p>
<p>“I feel like a parasite.” I couldn’t even run to the store for</p>
<p>emergency tampons without calling Vee. Worse, I’d come this</p>
<p>close to having to hitch a ride to school today with Marcie Millar.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to make unnecessary demands on my mom,</p>
<p>especially when money was so tight, but I didn’t want a repeat</p>
<p>of this morning, either. I’d been longing for a car ever since my</p>
<p>mom sold the Fiat, and seeing the Cabriolet this afternoon had</p>
<p>pushed me to action. Paying for the car myself seemed like a</p>
<p>good compromise.</p>
<p>“You don’t think a job will interfere with school?” Mom asked,</p>
<p>her tone telling me she wasn’t wild about the idea. Not that I’d</p>
<p>expected her to be.</p>
<p>“I’m only taking one class.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but it’s chemistry.”</p>
<p>“No offense, but I think I can handle two things at once.”</p>
<p>At that, she sat on the edge of my bed. “Is something the</p>
<p>matter? You’re awfully snappy tonight.”</p>
<p>I took an extra second to answer, coming very close to telling</p>
<p>the truth. “No. I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“You seem stressed.”</p>
<p>“Long day. Oh, and did I mention Marcie Millar is my chem</p>
<p>partner?”</p>
<p>I could tell by her expression that she knew just how deeply</p>
<p>this cut. After all, it was my mom I’d run home to for most of the</p>
<p>past eleven years after Marcie had had her way with me. And it</p>
<p>was my mom who’d picked up the pieces, put me back</p>
<p>together, and sent me back to school stronger and wiser and</p>
<p>armed with a few tricks of my own.</p>
<p>“I’m stuck with her for eight weeks.”</p>
<p>“Tell you what, if you survive all eight weeks without killing her,</p>
<p>we can talk about getting you a car.”</p>
<p>we can talk about getting you a car.”</p>
<p>“You drive a hard bargain, Mom.”</p>
<p>She kissed my forehead. “I’ll expect a full report on the first</p>
<p>couple of days when I get back from my trip. No wild parties</p>
<p>while I’m gone.”</p>
<p>“Imake no promises.”</p>
<p>Five minutes later, my mom steered her Taurus down the</p>
<p>driveway. I let the curtain drop back in place, curled into the</p>
<p>sofa, and stared at my cell phone.</p>
<p>But no calls came in.</p>
<p>I reached for Patch’s necklace, still fastened around my</p>
<p>neck, and squeezed it harder than I expected. I was struck by</p>
<p>the horrible thought that it might be all I had left of him.</p><p>

<p></p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>THEDREAMCAMEINTHREECOLORS: BLACK, WHITE, and a wan gray.</p>
<p>It was a cold night. I stood barefoot on the dirt road, sludge</p>
<p>and rain quickly filling the potholes pockmarking it. Rocks and</p>
<p>skeletal weeds sprang up intermittently. Darkness consumed</p>
<p>the countryside, except for one bright spot: A few hundred yards</p>
<p>off the road sat a stone-and-wood tavern. Candles guttered in</p>
<p>the windows, and I was just about to head toward the tavern for</p>
<p>shelter when I heard the distant jangle of bells.</p>
<p>As the sound of the bells grew louder, I moved a safe</p>
<p>distance off the road. I watched as a horse-drawn coach rattled</p>
<p>out of the darkness and came to a halt where I’d been standing</p>
<p>moments before. As soon as the wheels stopped rolling, the</p>
<p>driver flung himself off the coach, splattering mud halfway up his</p>
<p>boots. He tugged on the door and stepped back.</p>
<p>A dark form emerged. A man. A cape hung from his</p>
<p>shoulders, flapping open in the wind, but the hood was drawn to</p>
<p>cover his face.</p>
<p>“Wait here,” he told the driver.</p>
<p>“My lord, it’s raining heavily—”</p>
<p>The man in the cape gave a nod in the direction of the tavern.</p>
<p>“I have business. I shan’t be long. Keep the horses ready.”</p>
<p>The driver’s eyes shifted to the tavern. “But m’lord … it’s</p>
<p>thieves and vagabonds that keep company there. And there’s</p>
<p>bad air tonight. I feel it in my bones.” He rubbed his arms</p>
<p>briskly, as if to fight off a chill. “M’lord might be better to hurry</p>
<p>back home to the lady and little ’uns.”</p>
<p>“Speak nothing of this to my wife.” The man in the cape</p>
<p>flexed and opened his gloved hands while fixing his gaze on the</p>
<p>tavern. “She has enough to worry about,” he murmured.</p>
<p>I turned my attention to the tavern, and the ominous</p>
<p>candlelight flickering in its small, slanted windows. The roof was</p>
<p>crooked too, tilting slightly to the right, as if the tools used to</p>
<p>construct it had been far from exact. Weeds choked the</p>
<p>exterior, and every now and then a rowdy yell or the sound of</p>
<p>shattered glass traveled out from its walls.</p>
<p>The driver dragged the sleeve of his coat under his nose.</p>
<p>“My own son died of the plague not two years past. A terrible</p>
<p>thing, what you and the lady are sufferin’ through.”</p>
<p>In the stiff silence that followed, the horses stamped</p>
<p>impatiently, their coats steaming. Little puffs of frost rose from</p>
<p>their nostrils. The picture was so authentic, it suddenly scared</p>
<p>me. Never before had any of my dreams felt this real.</p>
<p>The man in the cape had started across the cobblestone</p>
<p>walkway leading to the tavern. The edges of the dream</p>
<p>vanished behind him, and after a moment’s hesitation I started</p>
<p>after him, afraid I’d disappear too, if I didn’t stay close. I slipped</p>
<p>through the tavern door behind him.</p>
<p>Halfway down the back wall was a giant oven with a brick</p>
<p>chimney. Various wooden bowls, tin cups, and utensils flanked</p>
<p>chimney. Various wooden bowls, tin cups, and utensils flanked</p>
<p>the walls to either side of the oven, hanging in place on large</p>
<p>nails. Three barrels had been rolled into the corner. A mangy</p>
<p>dog was curled up in a sleeping ball in front of them. Overturned</p>
<p>stools and a haphazard arrangement of dirty dishes and mugs</p>
<p>cluttered the floor, which was hardly a floor at all. It was dirt,</p>
<p>tamped smooth and sprinkled with what looked like sawdust,</p>
<p>and the moment I stepped on it, the mud already caked on my</p>
<p>heels sponged up the dusty earth. I was just wishing for a hot</p>
<p>shower, when the appearance of the ten or so customers sitting</p>
<p>at various tables around the tavern penetrated my awareness.</p>
<p>Most of the men had shoulder-length hair with odd, pointed</p>
<p>beards. Their pants were baggy and tucked into tall boots, and</p>
<p>their sleeves billowed. They wore broad-brimmed hats that</p>
<p>reminded me of pilgrims.</p>
<p>I was definitely dreaming of a time far back in history, and</p>
<p>since the detail of the dream was so vivid, I should have had at</p>
<p>least some idea of what time period I’d dreamed myself into.</p>
<p>But I was at a loss. Most likely England, but anywhere from the</p>
<p>fifteenth to the eighteenth century. I’d gotten anA in world history</p>
<p>this year, but period clothing hadn’t been on any of our tests.</p>
<p>Nothing in the scene before me had.</p>
<p>“I’m looking for a man,” the man in the cape said to the</p>
<p>bartender, who was positioned behind a waist-high table that I</p>
<p>assumed served as the bar. “I was told to meet him here</p>
<p>tonight, but I’m afraid I don’t know his name.”</p>
<p>The bartender, a short man, bald except for a few wiry hairs</p>
<p>standing on end at the top of his head, eyed the man in the</p>
<p>cape. “Something to drink?” he asked, spreading his lips to</p>
<p>show jagged black stumps for teeth.</p>
<p>I swallowed the nausea that rolled through my stomach at the</p>
<p>sight of his teeth and stepped back.</p>
<p>The man in the cape didn’t show my same revulsion. He</p>
<p>merely shook his head. “I need to find this man as quickly as</p>
<p>possible. Iwas told you’d be able to help.”</p>
<p>The bartender’s rotted smile faded back behind his lips.</p>
<p>“Aye, I can help you find him, m’lord. But trust an old man and</p>
<p>have a drink or two first. Something to warm your blood on a</p>
<p>cold night.” He pushed a small glass at the man.</p>
<p>Behind the hood, the man shook his head again. “I’m afraid</p>
<p>I’m in a bit of a hurry. Tell me where I can find him.” He pushed a</p>
<p>few warped tokens across the table.</p>
<p>The bartender pocketed the tokens. Jerking his head at the</p>
<p>back door, he said, “He keeps to the forest yonder. But m’lord?</p>
<p>Be careful. Some say the forest is haunted. Some say the man</p>
<p>who goes into the forest is the man who never comes back out.”</p>
<p>The man in the cape leaned on the table dividing the two and</p>
<p>lowered his voice. “I wish to ask a personal question. Does the</p>
<p>Jewish month of Cheshvan mean anything to you?”</p>
<p>“I am not a Jew,” the bartender said flatly, but something in</p>
<p>his eyes told me this wasn’t the first time he’d been asked the</p>
<p>question.</p>
<p>“The man I’ve come to see tonight told me to meet him here</p>
<p>on the first night of Cheshvan. He said he needed me to provide</p>
<p>a service for him, for the duration of an entire fortnight.”</p>
<p>The bartender stroked his chin. “A fortnight is a long time.”</p>
<p>The bartender stroked his chin. “A fortnight is a long time.”</p>
<p>“Too long. I wouldn’t have come, but I was afraid of what the</p>
<p>man might do if I didn’t. He mentioned my family by name. He</p>
<p>knew them. I have a beautiful wife and four sons. I don’t want</p>
<p>them harmed.”</p>
<p>The bartender dropped his voice, as if to share a piece of</p>
<p>scandalous gossip. “The man you’ve come to see is …” He</p>
<p>trailed off, casting a suspicious look around the tavern.</p>
<p>“He’s unusually powerful,” the man in the cape said. “I’ve</p>
<p>seen his strength before, and he is a mighty man. I’ve come to</p>
<p>reason with him. Surely he can’t expect me to abandon my</p>
<p>duties and family for such a length of time. The man will be</p>
<p>reasonable.”</p>
<p>“I know nothing of this man’s reason,” the bartender said.</p>
<p>“My youngest son has contracted the plague,” the man in the</p>
<p>cape explained, his voice taking on a quiver of desperation.</p>
<p>“The doctors do not think he’ll live long. My family needs me. My</p>
<p>son needs me.”</p>
<p>“Have a drink,” the bartender said quietly. He nudged the</p>
<p>glass forward a second time.</p>
<p>The man in the cape turned abruptly from the table and</p>
<p>strode toward the back door. I followed.</p>
<p>Outside, I sloshed barefoot through the icy mud after him.</p>
<p>The rain continued to pour down, and I had to walk carefully to</p>
<p>avoid slipping. I wiped my eyes and saw the man’s cape</p>
<p>disappear into the line of trees at the edge of the forest.</p>
<p>I stumbled after him, hesitating at the tree line. Cupping my</p>
<p>hands to hold back my wet hair, I peered into the deep shadow</p>
<p>ahead.</p>
<p>There was a flash of movement and suddenly the man in the</p>
<p>cape was running back toward me. He tripped and fell. The</p>
<p>branches snagged his cape; in a frenzy, he struggled to untie it</p>
<p>from his neck. He gave a high shriek of terror. His arms flailed</p>
<p>wildly, his whole body twisting and jerking convulsively.</p>
<p>I shoved my way toward him, twigs scraping my arms, rocks</p>
<p>stabbing at my bare feet. I dropped to my knees beside him.</p>
<p>His hood was still mostly drawn, but I could see that his mouth</p>
<p>was slightly open, paralyzed in a scream.</p>
<p>“Roll over!” I ordered him, yanking to free the fabric trapped</p>
<p>beneath him.</p>
<p>But he couldn’t hear me. For the first time, the dream took on</p>
<p>a familiar edge. Just like every other nightmare I’d ever been</p>
<p>trapped in, the harder I struggled, the more the very thing I</p>
<p>wanted slipped out of reach.</p>
<p>I grabbed his shoulders and shook him. “Roll over! I can get</p>
<p>you out of here, but you have to help.”</p>
<p>“I’m Barnabas Underwood,” he slurred. “Do you know the</p>
<p>way to the tavern? That’s a good girl,” he said, patting the air as</p>
<p>if he was patting an imaginary cheek.</p>
<p>I stiffened. There was no way he could see me. He was</p>
<p>hallucinating about another girl. He had to be. How could he see</p>
<p>me if he couldn’t hear me?</p>
<p>“Run back and tell the barkeep to send help,” he continued.</p>
<p>“Tell him there is no man. Tell him it is one of the devil’s angels,</p>
<p>come to possess my body and cast away my soul. Tell him to</p>
<p>send for a priest, holy water, and roses.”</p>
<p>send for a priest, holy water, and roses.”</p>
<p>At the mention of the devil’s angels, the hairs on my arms</p>
<p>rose.</p>
<p>He snapped his head back toward the forest, straining his</p>
<p>neck. “The angel!” he whispered in a panic. “The angel is</p>
<p>coming!”</p>
<p>His mouth twisted into distorted shapes, and it looked like he</p>
<p>was fighting for control of his own body. He arched back</p>
<p>violently, and his hood was flung all the way off.</p>
<p>I was still clutching the cape, but I felt my hands reflexively</p>
<p>slacken. I stared at the man with a gasp of surprise caught in</p>
<p>my throat. He wasn’t Barnabas Underwood.</p>
<p>He was Hank Millar.</p>
<p>Marcie’s dad.</p>
<p>I blinked my eyes awake.</p>
<p>Rays of light blazed through my bedroom window. The pane</p>
<p>was cracked, and a lazy breeze rustled the first breath of</p>
<p>morning across my skin. My heart was still working in double</p>
<p>time from the nightmare, but I sucked in a deep breath and</p>
<p>reassured myself it wasn’t real. Truth be told, now that my feet</p>
<p>were planted firmly in my own world, I was more disturbed over</p>
<p>the fact that I’d been dreaming about Marcie’s dad than</p>
<p>anything else. In a hurry to forget it, I shoved the dream aside.</p>
<p>I dragged my cell phone out from under my pillow and</p>
<p>checked for messages. Patch hadn’t called. Drawing the pillow</p>
<p>against me, I curled into it and tried to ignore the hollow</p>
<p>sensation inside me. How many hours had it been since Patch</p>
<p>walked out? Twelve. How many more until I saw him again? I</p>
<p>didn’t know. That was what really worried me. The more time</p>
<p>passed, the more I felt the wall of ice between us thicken.</p>
<p>Just get through today, I told myself, swallowing the pebble</p>
<p>in my throat. The strange distance between us couldn’t go on</p>
<p>forever. Nothing was going to get resolved if I hid out in bed all</p>
<p>day. I would see Patch again. He might even stop by after</p>
<p>school. Either that, or I could call him. I kept on with these</p>
<p>ridiculous thoughts, refusing to let myself think about the</p>
<p>archangels. About hell. About how scared I was that Patch and I</p>
<p>were facing a problem neither of us was strong enough to solve.</p>
<p>I rolled out of bed and found a yellow Post-it note stuck to the</p>
<p>bathroom mirror.</p>
<p>The good news: I convinced Lynn not to send</p>
<p>Scott over this morning to pick you up. The</p>
<p>bad news: Lynn is set on the tour of town. At</p>
<p>this point I’m not sure saying no is going to</p>
<p>work. Would you mind taking him around after</p>
<p>class? Keep it short. Really short. I left his</p>
<p>number on the kitchen counter.</p>
<p>X OX O —Mom</p>
<p>P.S. I’ll call you tonight from my hotel.</p>
<p>I groaned and lowered my forehead to the counter. I didn’t</p>
<p>want to spend ten more minutes with Scott, let alone a couple of</p>
<p>hours.</p>
<p>Forty minutes later, I’d showered, dressed, and consumed a</p>
<p>bowl of strawberry oatmeal. There was a knock at the front</p>
<p>door, and I opened it to find Vee smiling. “Ready for another funfilled</p>
<p>day of summer school?” she asked.</p>
<p>I grabbed my backpack off a hook in the coat closet. “Let’s</p>
<p>just get this day over with, okay?”</p>
<p>“Whoa. Who peed in your Cheerios?”</p>
<p>“Scott Parnell.” Patch.</p>
<p>“I see the incontinence problem didn’t go away over time.”</p>
<p>“I’m supposed to give him a tour of town after class.”</p>
<p>“One-on-one time with a boy. What’s to hate?”</p>
<p>“You should have been here last night. Dinner was bizarre.</p>
<p>Scott’s mom started to tell us about his troubled past, but Scott</p>
<p>cut her off. Not only that, but it almost seemed like he was</p>
<p>threatening her. Then he excused himself to use the bathroom,</p>
<p>but ended up eavesdropping on us from the hall.” And then</p>
<p>spoke to his mom’s thoughts. Maybe.</p>
<p>“Sounds like he’s trying to keep his life private. Sounds like</p>
<p>we might have to do something to change that.”</p>
<p>I was two steps ahead of Vee, leading the way out, and I</p>
<p>came up short. I’d just experienced a flash of inspiration. “I have</p>
<p>a great idea,” I said, turning around. “Why don’t you give Scott</p>
<p>the tour? No, seriously, Vee. You’ll love him. He has that</p>
<p>reckless, anti-rules, bad-boy attitude. He even asked if we had</p>
<p>beer—scandalous, right? I think he’s right up your alley.”</p>
<p>“No can do. I’ve got a lunch date with Rixon.”</p>
<p>I felt an unexpected stab in the vicinity of my heart. Patch and</p>
<p>I had lunch plans today too, but somehow I doubted they were</p>
<p>happening. What had I done? I had to call him. I had to find a</p>
<p>way to talk to him. I wasn’t going to end things like this. It was</p>
<p>absurd. But a small voice that I despised questioned why he</p>
<p>hadn’t called first. He had just as much to apologize for as I did.</p>
<p>“I’ll pay you eight dollars and thirty-two cents to take Scott</p>
<p>around, final offer,” I said.</p>
<p>“Tempting, but no. And here’s another thing. Patch probably</p>
<p>isn’t going to be a happy camper if you and Scott make a habit</p>
<p>of this exclusive time. Don’t get me wrong. I couldn’t care less</p>
<p>what Patch thinks, and if you want to drive him crazy, more</p>
<p>power to you. Still, I thought I’d raise the point.”</p>
<p>I was halfway down the front porch steps, and my footing</p>
<p>slipped at the mention of Patch. I thought about telling Vee that</p>
<p>I’d called things off, but I wasn’t ready to say it out loud. I felt my</p>
<p>cell phone, with Patch’s picture saved on it, burning in my</p>
<p>pocket. Part of me wanted to hurl the phone into the trees on the</p>
<p>far side of the road. Part of me couldn’t lose him that quickly.</p>
<p>Besides, if I told Vee, she’d inevitably point out that a breakup</p>
<p>made us free to date other people, which was the wrong</p>
<p>conclusion. I wasn’t looking elsewhere, and neither was Patch. I</p>
<p>hoped. This was just a snag. Our first real fight. The breakup</p>
<p>hoped. This was just a snag. Our first real fight. The breakup</p>
<p>wasn’t permanent. Caught up in the moment, we’d both said</p>
<p>things we didn’t mean.</p>
<p>“If I were you, I’d bail,” Vee said, her four-inch heels stabbing</p>
<p>down the steps behind me. “That’s what I do whenever I find</p>
<p>myself in a jam. Call Scott and tell him your cat’s coughing up</p>
<p>mice intestines, and you have to take it to the vet after school.”</p>
<p>“He was over here last night. He knows I don’t have a cat.”</p>
<p>“Then unless he’s got overcooked spaghetti for brains, he’ll</p>
<p>figure out you’re not interested.”</p>
<p>I considered this. If I got out of giving Scott a tour of town,</p>
<p>maybe I could borrow Vee’s car and follow him. Try as I might to</p>
<p>rationalize what I’d heard last night, I couldn’t ignore the nagging</p>
<p>suspicion that Scott had spoken to his mom’s thoughts. One</p>
<p>year ago I would have brushed the idea off as ridiculous. But</p>
<p>things were different now. Patch had spoken to my thoughts</p>
<p>numerous times. So had Chauncey (a.k.a. Jules), a Nephil from</p>
<p>my past. Since fallen angels didn’t age, and I’d known Scott</p>
<p>since he was five, I’d already ruled that out. But even if Scott</p>
<p>wasn’t a fallen angel, he could still be Nephilim.</p>
<p>But if he was Nephilim, what was he doing in Coldwater?</p>
<p>What was he doing living an ordinary teen life? Did he know he</p>
<p>was Nephilim? Did Lynn? Had Scott sworn fealty to a fallen</p>
<p>angel yet? If he hadn’t, was it my responsibility to warn him</p>
<p>about what lay ahead? I hadn’t instantly hit it off with Scott, but</p>
<p>that didn’t mean I thought he deserved to give up his body for</p>
<p>two weeks every year.</p>
<p>Of course, maybe he wasn’t Nephilim at all. Maybe I was</p>
<p>getting carried away with the imagined belief that I’d overheard</p>
<p>him speak to his mom’s thoughts.</p>
<p>After chemistry I swung by my locker, traded out my textbook</p>
<p>for my backpack and cell, then walked to the side doors offering</p>
<p>a clear view of the student parking lot. Scott was sitting on the</p>
<p>hood of his silver-blue Mustang. He was still wearing the</p>
<p>Hawaiian hat, and it dawned on me that if he kept this up, I</p>
<p>wouldn’t recognize him without it. Case in point: I didn’t even</p>
<p>know his hair color. I pulled the Post-it note my mom had left for</p>
<p>me out of my pocket and dialed his number.</p>
<p>“This must be Nora Grey,” he answered. “I hope you’re not</p>
<p>ditching me.”</p>
<p>“Bad news. My cat’s sick. The vet squeezed me in for a</p>
<p>twelve thirty appointment. I’m going to have to take a rain check</p>
<p>on the tour. Sorry,” I finished, not expecting to feel quite this</p>
<p>guilty. After all, it was just a little lie. And not one part of me</p>
<p>honestly believed that Scott wanted a tour of Coldwater. At</p>
<p>least, that’s what Iwas telling myself to ease my conscience.</p>
<p>“Right,” Scott said, and broke the connection.</p>
<p>I’d only just closed my cell phone when Vee came up behind</p>
<p>me. “Let him down easy, that’s my girl.”</p>
<p>“Do you mind if I borrow the Neon for the afternoon?” I asked,</p>
<p>watching Scott slide off the Mustang and place a call on his cell.</p>
<p>“What’s the occasion?”</p>
<p>“Iwant to tail Scott.”</p>
<p>“What for? This morning you made it pretty clear you think</p>
<p>he’s a bottom-feeder.”</p>
<p>“Something about him is … off.”</p>
<p>“Something about him is … off.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s called his sunglasses. Hulk Hogan, anyone? Either</p>
<p>way, no can do. I have my lunch date with Rixon.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but Rixon could give you a ride so I can have the</p>
<p>Neon,” I said, shooting a glance through the window to confirm</p>
<p>that Scott hadn’t hopped inside the Mustang yet. I didn’t want</p>
<p>him leaving before I convinced Vee to hand over the Neon’s</p>
<p>keys.</p>
<p>“Of course he can. But then I’d look needy. Guys today want a</p>
<p>strong, independent woman.”</p>
<p>“If you let me take the Neon, I’ll fill up the tank.”</p>
<p>Vee’s expression softened just a tad. “All the way?”</p>
<p>“All the way.” Or as much as eight dollars and thirty-two cents</p>
<p>would buy.</p>
<p>Vee chewed her lip. “Okay,” she said slowly. “But maybe I</p>
<p>should come along and keep you company, make sure nothing</p>
<p>bad happens.”</p>
<p>“What about Rixon?”</p>
<p>“Just because I’ve gone and snagged myself a hot boyfriend</p>
<p>doesn’t mean I’m going to leave my best friend high and dry.</p>
<p>Besides, I have a feeling you’re going to need my help.”</p>
<p>“Nothing bad is going to happen. I’m tailing him. He’s not</p>
<p>going to know I’m there.” But I appreciated the offer. The past</p>
<p>few months had changed me. Iwasn’t as naive and heedless as</p>
<p>I’d once been, and taking Vee along appealed to me on more</p>
<p>than one level. Especially if Scott was Nephilim. The only other</p>
<p>Nephil I’d known had tried to kill me.</p>
<p>After Vee called Rixon and canceled, we waited until Scott</p>
<p>had angled himself behind the steering wheel and backed out</p>
<p>of his parking space before we exited the building. He turned</p>
<p>left out of the parking lot, and Vee and I raced for her 1995</p>
<p>purple Dodge Neon. “You drive,” Vee said, tossing me the keys.</p>
<p>A handful of minutes later, we caught up to the Mustang, and I</p>
<p>hung three cars back. Scott got on the highway, heading east</p>
<p>toward the coast, and I followed.</p>
<p>A half hour later, Scott exited at the pier and steered into a</p>
<p>parking lot at the edge of the strip of shops leading out to the</p>
<p>ocean. I drove slower, allowing him time to lock the doors and</p>
<p>walk away, then parked two rows over.</p>
<p>“Looks like Scotty the Potty is going shopping,” Vee said.</p>
<p>“Speaking of shopping, you don’t mind if I have a look around</p>
<p>while you run amateur-hour surveillance? Rixon said he likes it</p>
<p>when girls accessorize with scarves, and my wardrobe is clean</p>
<p>out of scarves.”</p>
<p>“Go for it.”</p>
<p>Staying a half block behind Scott, I watched him walk into a</p>
<p>trendy clothing store and exit less than fifteen minutes later with</p>
<p>a shopping bag. He went into another store and came out ten</p>
<p>minutes later. Nothing out of the ordinary, and nothing that made</p>
<p>me think he could be Nephilim. After a third store, Scott’s</p>
<p>attention was drawn toward a group of college-age girls eating</p>
<p>lunch across the street. They sat at an umbrella table on the</p>
<p>restaurant’s outdoor terrace, wearing cutoffs and bikini tops.</p>
<p>Scott pulled out his camera phone and clicked a few candid</p>
<p>pictures.</p>
<p>I turned to grimace in the plate-glass window of the coffee</p>
<p>I turned to grimace in the plate-glass window of the coffee</p>
<p>shop beside me, and that was when I saw him sitting at a booth</p>
<p>inside. He was dressed in khakis, a blue button-down, and an</p>
<p>ivory linen blazer. His wavy blond hair was longer now, pulled</p>
<p>back into a low ponytail. He was reading the paper.</p>
<p>My dad.</p>
<p>He folded the paper and walked toward the back of the shop.</p>
<p>I ran down the sidewalk to the coffee shop’s entrance and</p>
<p>pushed my way inside. My dad had disappeared in the crowd. I</p>
<p>jogged to the back of the shop, frantically looking around. The</p>
<p>black-and-white tiled hallway ended with the men’s room on the</p>
<p>left, the women’s on the right. There was no other exit, which</p>
<p>meant my dad had to be in the men’s room.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Scott asked from directly over my</p>
<p>shoulder.</p>
<p>Iwhirled around. “How—what—what are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“I was just about to ask you the same thing. I know you</p>
<p>followed me. Don’t look so surprised. It’s called a rearview</p>
<p>mirror.Are you stalking me for a specific reason?”</p>
<p>My thoughts were too jumbled to care what he was saying.</p>
<p>“Go inside the men’s room and tell me if there’s a man in a blue</p>
<p>shirt in there.”</p>
<p>Scott tapped my forehead. “Drugs? Behavioral disorder?</p>
<p>You’re acting schizo.”</p>
<p>“Just do it.”</p>
<p>Scott gave the door a kick, sending it flying open. I heard the</p>
<p>swinging of stall doors, and a moment later he returned.</p>
<p>“Nada.”</p>
<p>“I saw a man in a blue shirt walk back here. There’s no other</p>
<p>way out.” I turned my attention to the door across the hall—the</p>
<p>only other door. I stepped inside the ladies’ room and nudged</p>
<p>each stall open one at a time, my heart up in my throat. All three</p>
<p>were empty.</p>
<p>I realized I was holding my breath, and let it out. I had several</p>
<p>emotions strung tight inside me, disappointment and fear at the</p>
<p>top of the list. I’d thought I’d seen my dad alive. But it had turned</p>
<p>out to be a cruel trick of my imagination. My dad was gone. He</p>
<p>was never coming back, and I needed to figure out a way to</p>
<p>accept it. I crouched down with my back to the wall and felt my</p>
<p>whole body shake with tears.</p><p>

<p></p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>SCOTT STOOD IN THE ENTRANCE, ARMS FOLDED. “SO this is what the</p>
<p>inside of a women’s restroom looks like. Got to say, it’s a lot</p>
<p>cleaner.”</p>
<p>I kept my head bowed and wiped my nose with the back of</p>
<p>my hand. “Do you mind?”</p>
<p>“I’m not leaving until you tell me why you followed me. I know</p>
<p>I’m a fascinating guy, but this is starting to feel like an unhealthy</p>
<p>obsession.”</p>
<p>I pushed myself to my feet and splashed cold water on my</p>
<p>face. Avoiding Scott’s reflection in the mirror, I grabbed a paper</p>
<p>towel and dried off.</p>
<p>“You’re also going to tell me who you were looking for in the</p>
<p>men’s room,” said Scott.</p>
<p>“I thought I saw my dad,” I shot back, summoning up all the</p>
<p>anger I could to mask the stabbing pain deep inside. “There.</p>
<p>Satisfied?” I wadded up the towel and flung it in the trash. I was</p>
<p>heading for the exit when Scott let the door drop closed and</p>
<p>leaned against it, blocking me.</p>
<p>“Once they find the guy who did it and send him away for life,</p>
<p>you’ll feel better.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for the worst advice I’ve received yet,” I said bitterly,</p>
<p>thinking that what would make me feel better was having my</p>
<p>dad back.</p>
<p>“Trust me. My dad’s a cop. He lives for telling surviving family</p>
<p>members that he found the killer. They’re going to find the guy</p>
<p>who destroyed your family and make him pay. A life for a life.</p>
<p>That’s when you get your peace. Let’s get out of here. I feel like</p>
<p>a creep standing in the girls’ room.” He waited. “That was</p>
<p>supposed to make you laugh.”</p>
<p>“Not in the mood.”</p>
<p>He laced his fingers together on top of his head and</p>
<p>shrugged, looking uncomfortable, like he hated awkward</p>
<p>moments, let alone knew how to resolve them. “Listen, I’m</p>
<p>playing pool at this dive in Springvale tonight. You wanna?”</p>
<p>“Pass.” I wasn’t in the mood to play pool. All it would</p>
<p>accomplish was to fill my head with unwanted memories of</p>
<p>Patch. I remembered that very first night when I chased him</p>
<p>down to finish a bio assignment and found him playing pool in</p>
<p>the basement of Bo’s. I remembered when he taught me to play</p>
<p>pool. I remembered the way he stood behind me, so close I felt</p>
<p>electricity.</p>
<p>Even more, I remembered the way he had always shown up</p>
<p>when I needed him. But I needed him now. Where was he? Was</p>
<p>he thinking of me?</p>
<p>I stood on the front porch rifling through my handbag for keys.</p>
<p>My rain-soaked shoes squeaked against the boards, and my</p>
<p>wet jeans rubbed a rash on the inside of my thighs. After tailing</p>
<p>Scott, Vee had dragged me into several boutiques to get my</p>
<p>opinion on scarves, and while Iwas giving her my thoughts on a</p>
<p>violet silk versus a folksy hand-painted one in neutrals, a storm</p>
<p>had blown in from the sea. By the time we’d sprinted to the</p>
<p>parking lot and flung ourselves inside the Neon, we’d gone from</p>
<p>dry to drenched. We’d blasted the heat the whole drive home,</p>
<p>but my teeth were chattering, my clothes felt like ice painted on</p>
<p>my skin, and Iwas still shaken from believing I’d seen my dad.</p>
<p>I shoved my shoulder against the humidity-swelled door, then</p>
<p>patted the inside wall until my fingers fumbled the light switch. In</p>
<p>the upstairs bathroom, I peeled out of my clothes and hung them</p>
<p>over the shower rod to dry. On the other side of the window,</p>
<p>lightning pitchforked down through the sky and thunder</p>
<p>clamored like it was stomping on the roof.</p>
<p>I’d been alone in the farmhouse through numerous storms</p>
<p>before, but all the experience hadn’t made me any more</p>
<p>accustomed to them. This afternoon’s storm was no exception.</p>
<p>Vee was supposed to be here now, sleeping over, but she’d</p>
<p>decided to meet up with Rixon for a few hours since she’d</p>
<p>canceled on him earlier. I wished I could travel back in time and</p>
<p>tell her I’d tail Scott by myself, if she’d make sure to keep me</p>
<p>company at the farmhouse this evening.</p>
<p>The bathroom lights flickered twice. That was all the warning I</p>
<p>got before they drained, leaving me standing in shadowy</p>
<p>darkness. Rain threw itself against the window, streaming down</p>
<p>it in rivers. I stood in place a moment, waiting to see if the</p>
<p>electricity would be restored. The rain turned to hail, striking the</p>
<p>windowpanes hard enough that I feared the glass would crack.</p>
<p>windowpanes hard enough that I feared the glass would crack.</p>
<p>I called Vee. “My electricity just went out.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, the streetlights just died on me. Slackers.”</p>
<p>“Want to drive back and keep me company?”</p>
<p>“Let’s see. Not especially.”</p>
<p>“You promised you’d sleep over.”</p>
<p>“I also promised Rixon I’d meet him at Taco Bell. I’m not</p>
<p>going to cancel on him twice in one day. Give me a few hours,</p>
<p>then I’m all yours. I’ll call you when I’m done. I’ll definitely be</p>
<p>there before midnight.”</p>
<p>I hung up and squeezed my memory, trying to remember</p>
<p>where I’d last seen the matches. It wasn’t dark enough that I</p>
<p>needed candles to see, but I liked the idea of lighting up the</p>
<p>place as much as possible, especially since I was alone. Light</p>
<p>had a way of keeping the monsters of my imagination at bay.</p>
<p>There were candlesticks on the dining room table, I recalled,</p>
<p>wrapping myself in a towel and taking the stairs down to the</p>
<p>main level. And pillar candles in the cabinets. But where were</p>
<p>the matches?</p>
<p>A shadow moved in the fields behind the house, and I</p>
<p>snapped my head toward the kitchen windows. The sheeting</p>
<p>rain spilled down the panes, distorting the world outside, and I</p>
<p>stepped closer for a better look. Whatever I’d seen was gone.</p>
<p>A coyote, I told myself, feeling a sudden rush of adrenaline.</p>
<p>Just a coyote.</p>
<p>The kitchen phone shrilled, and I grabbed for it, half because</p>
<p>Iwas startled and half because Iwanted to hear a human voice.</p>
<p>I prayed it was Vee calling to say she’d changed her mind.</p>
<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>Iwaited.</p>
<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>Static crackled in my ear.</p>
<p>“Vee? Mom?” At the edge of my vision, I saw another</p>
<p>shadow slink through the fields. Sucking in a steadying breath, I</p>
<p>reminded myself there was no possible way that I was in any</p>
<p>true danger. Patch might not be my boyfriend, but he was still</p>
<p>my guardian angel. If there was trouble, he’d be here. But even</p>
<p>as I thought it, I wondered if I could count on Patch for anything</p>
<p>anymore.</p>
<p>He must hate me, I thought. He must want nothing to do with</p>
<p>me. He must still be furious, and that’s why he’d made no effort</p>
<p>to contact me.</p>
<p>The trouble with that train of thought was that it only made me</p>
<p>angry again. Here I was, worrying about him, but chances were,</p>
<p>wherever he was, he wasn’t worrying about me. He’d said he</p>
<p>wasn’t going to just swallow my decision to break up, but that’s</p>
<p>exactly what he’d done. He hadn’t texted or called. He hadn’t</p>
<p>anything. And it wasn’t like he didn’t have a reason. He could</p>
<p>knock on my door right this very minute and tell me what he’d</p>
<p>been doing at Marcie’s two nights ago. He could tell me why</p>
<p>he’d driven off when I told him I loved him.</p>
<p>Yes, I was angry. Only this time, I was going to do something</p>
<p>about it.</p>
<p>I slammed the home phone down and scrolled through my</p>
<p>cell phone, looking for Scott’s number. I was going to throw</p>
<p>caution to the wind and take him up on his offer. Even though I</p>
<p>knew it was for all the wrong reasons, I wanted to go out with</p>
<p>Scott. Iwanted to give Patch the finger. If he thought Iwas going</p>
<p>to sit home and cry over him, he was wrong. We’d broken up; I</p>
<p>was free to go out with other guys. And while I was at it, I was</p>
<p>going to test Patch’s ability to keep me safe. Maybe Scott really</p>
<p>was Nephilim. Maybe he was even trouble. Maybe he was</p>
<p>exactly the kind of guy I should stay away from. I felt a hard smile</p>
<p>cross my face as I realized it didn’t matter what I did, or what</p>
<p>Scott might do; Patch had to protect me.</p>
<p>“Have you left for Springvale yet?” I asked Scott, after keying</p>
<p>in his number.</p>
<p>“Hanging with me isn’t so bad after all?”</p>
<p>“If you’re going to rub it in, I’m not going.”</p>
<p>I heard him smile. “Easy, Grey, I’m just playing with you.”</p>
<p>I’d promised my mom I’d keep my distance from Scott, but I</p>
<p>wasn’t worried. If Scott messed with me, Patch would have to</p>
<p>step in.</p>
<p>“Well?” I said. “Are you going to pick me up or what?”</p>
<p>“I’ll swing by after seven.”</p>
<p>Springvale is a small fishing town, and most of it is crammed</p>
<p>onto Main Street: the post office, a few fish-and-chips diners,</p>
<p>tackle shops, and the Z Pool Hall.</p>
<p>The Z stood one story high, with a plate-glass window</p>
<p>offering a view inside to the pool hall and bar. Trash and weeds</p>
<p>decorated the exterior. Two men with shaved heads and</p>
<p>goatees were smoking on the sidewalk just outside the doors;</p>
<p>they ground out their cigarettes and disappeared inside.</p>
<p>Scott parked in an angled slot near the doors. “I’m going to</p>
<p>run down a couple blocks and find an ATM,” he said, killing the</p>
<p>engine.</p>
<p>I studied the storefront sign hanging above the window. THE Z</p>
<p>POOLHALL. The name tickled my memory.</p>
<p>“Why does this place sound familiar?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Couple weeks back a guy bled out on one of the tables. Bar</p>
<p>brawl. It was all over the news.”</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>“I’ll come with you,” I offered quickly.</p>
<p>He swung out, and I followed suit. “Nah,” he called over the</p>
<p>rain. “You’ll get soaked. Wait inside. I’ll be back in ten.” Without</p>
<p>giving me another chance to tag along, he hunched his</p>
<p>shoulders against the rain, shoved his hands in his pockets,</p>
<p>and jogged down the sidewalk.</p>
<p>Slicking rain off my face, I tucked myself under the building’s</p>
<p>overhang and summed up my options. I could go inside alone,</p>
<p>or I could wait here for Scott. I hadn’t waited five seconds</p>
<p>before my skin started to itch. While the sidewalk held little foot</p>
<p>traffic, it wasn’t completely desolate. Those who were out in the</p>
<p>weather wore flannel shirts and work boots. They looked bigger,</p>
<p>tougher, meaner than the men who loitered around Main Street</p>
<p>in Cold-water.A few gave me eyes as they passed.</p>
<p>I looked down the sidewalk in the direction Scott had taken</p>
<p>off and saw him round the building and disappear down the</p>
<p>side alley. My first thought was that he was going to have a hard</p>
<p>side alley. My first thought was that he was going to have a hard</p>
<p>time finding anATM in the alley next to the Z. My second thought</p>
<p>was that maybe he’d lied to me. Maybe he wasn’t going in</p>
<p>search of an ATM after all. But then what was he doing in an</p>
<p>alley, out in the rain? Iwanted to follow him but didn’t know how I</p>
<p>was going to stay out of sight. The last thing I needed was for</p>
<p>him to catch me spying on him again. It certainly wouldn’t</p>
<p>promote trust between us.</p>
<p>Thinking maybe I could figure out what he was doing by</p>
<p>watching through one of the windows inside the Z, I tugged on</p>
<p>the door handle.</p>
<p>The air inside was cool and coated with smoke and male</p>
<p>perspiration. The ceiling was low, the walls concrete. A few</p>
<p>posters of muscle cars, a Sports Illustrated calendar, and a</p>
<p>Budweiser mirror offered the only decoration. No windows</p>
<p>paneled the wall dividing me from Scott. I strolled down the</p>
<p>center aisle, wading deeper into the shadowy hall, and kept my</p>
<p>breathing shallow, trying to filter my intake of carcinogens. When I got to the back of the Z, I fixed my eyes on the exit</p>
<p>leading into the rear alley. Not quite as convenient as a window,</p>
<p>but it would have to do. If Scott caught me watching him, I could</p>
<p>always feign innocence and claim I’d stepped out for fresh air.</p>
<p>After making sure no one was watching, I opened the door and</p>
<p>stuck my head out.</p>
<p>Hands grabbed the collar of my jean jacket, yanked me out,</p>
<p>and backed me against the brick exterior.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?” Patch demanded. Rain hissed</p>
<p>down behind him, spilling off the metal awning.</p>
<p>“Playing pool,” I stammered, my heart still frozen from the</p>
<p>surprise of being ripped off my feet.</p>
<p>“Playing pool,” he repeated, not sounding even close to</p>
<p>buying it.</p>
<p>“I’m here with a friend. Scott Parnell.”</p>
<p>His expression hardened.</p>
<p>“Do you have a problem with that?” I shot back. “We broke</p>
<p>up, remember? I can go out with other guys if I want.” I was</p>
<p>angry—at the archangels, at fate, at consequences. I was angry</p>
<p>for being here with Scott, not Patch. And I was angry at Patch</p>
<p>for not pulling me into his arms and telling me he wanted to put</p>
<p>everything that had happened to us in the past twenty-four hours</p>
<p>behind him. Everything dividing us was washed away, and it</p>
<p>was just me and him from now on.</p>
<p>Patch dropped his gaze to the ground and pinched the</p>
<p>bridge of his nose. I could tell he was summoning patience from</p>
<p>deep within. “Scott’s Nephilim. A first-generation purebred. Just</p>
<p>like Chauncey was.”</p>
<p>I blinked. It was true, then. “Thanks for the info, but I already</p>
<p>suspected.”</p>
<p>He made a disgusted gesture. “Quit with the bravery act.</p>
<p>He’s Nephilim.”</p>
<p>“Every Nephil isn’t Chauncey Langeais,” I said testily. “Every</p>
<p>Nephil isn’t evil. If you’d give Scott a chance, you’d see he’s</p>
<p>actually quite—”</p>
<p>“Scott isn’t any old Nephil,” Patch said, cutting me off. “He</p>
<p>belongs to a Nephilim blood society that has been growing in</p>
<p>power. The society wants to free Nephilim from bondage to</p>
<p>fallen angels during Cheshvan. They’re recruiting members like</p>
<p>crazy to fight back against fallen angels, and a turf war is</p>
<p>brewing between the two sides. If the society becomes powerful</p>
<p>enough, fallen angels will back off … and start relying on</p>
<p>humans as their vassals instead.”</p>
<p>I bit my lip and looked up at him uneasily. Without wanting to,</p>
<p>I remembered last night’s dream. Cheshvan. Nephilim. Fallen</p>
<p>angels. I couldn’t escape any of it.</p>
<p>“Why don’t fallen angels usually possess humans?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Why do they choose Nephilim?”</p>
<p>“Human bodies aren’t as strong or resilient as Nephilim</p>
<p>bodies,” Patch replied. “A two-week-long possession will kill</p>
<p>them. Tens of thousands of humans would die every Cheshvan.</p>
<p>“And it’s a lot harder to possess a human,” he continued.</p>
<p>“Fallen angels can’t force humans to swear fealty, they have to</p>
<p>convince them to turn over their bodies. That takes time and</p>
<p>persuasion. Human bodies also deteriorate faster. Not many</p>
<p>fallen angels want to go to the trouble of possessing a human</p>
<p>body if it could be dead in a week.”</p>
<p>A shiver of foreboding crept through me, but I said, “That’s a</p>
<p>sad story, but it’s hard to blame Scott or any Nephilim, for that</p>
<p>matter. I wouldn’t want a fallen angel taking control of my body</p>
<p>two weeks out of every year either. This doesn’t sound like a</p>
<p>Nephilim problem. It sounds like a fallen angel problem.”</p>
<p>A muscle in his jaw jumped. “The Z isn’t your kind of place.</p>
<p>Go home.”</p>
<p>“I just got here.”</p>
<p>“I just got here.”</p>
<p>“Bo’s is mild compared to this place.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for the tip, but I’m not really in the mood to hang out</p>
<p>at home all night feeling sorry for myself.”</p>
<p>Patch folded his arms and studied me. “You’re putting</p>
<p>yourself in danger to get back at me?” he guessed. “In case you</p>
<p>forgot, I’m not the one who called things off.”</p>
<p>“Don’t flatter yourself. This isn’t about you.”</p>
<p>Patch dug in his pocket for his keys. “I’m taking you home.”</p>
<p>His tone told me Iwas a huge inconvenience, and that if he saw</p>
<p>any way around it, he’d gladly opt out.</p>
<p>“I don’t want a ride. I don’t need your help.”</p>
<p>He laughed, but the sound lacked humor. “You’re getting in</p>
<p>the Jeep, even if I have to drag you inside, because you’re not</p>
<p>staying here. It’s too dangerous.”</p>
<p>“You can’t order me around.”</p>
<p>He merely looked at me. “And while you’re at it, you’re going</p>
<p>to stop hanging out with Scott.”</p>
<p>I felt my anger bubbling up. How dare he assume I was weak</p>
<p>and helpless. How dare he try to control me by telling me where</p>
<p>I could and couldn’t go, and who I could spend time with. How</p>
<p>dare he act like I’d meant nothing to him.</p>
<p>I sent him a look of cool defiance. “Don’t do me any more</p>
<p>favors. I never asked. And I don’t want you as my guardian</p>
<p>angel anymore.”</p>
<p>Patch stood over me, and a drop of rain slid from his hair,</p>
<p>landing like ice on my collarbone. I felt it slide along my skin,</p>
<p>disappearing beneath the neckline of my shirt. His eyes</p>
<p>followed the raindrop, and I began to quiver on the inside. I</p>
<p>wanted to tell him I was sorry for everything I’d said. I wanted to</p>
<p>tell him I didn’t care about Marcie, or what the archangels</p>
<p>thought. I cared about us. But the cold hard truth was, nothing I</p>
<p>said or did could realign the stars. I couldn’t care about us. Not</p>
<p>if Iwanted to keep Patch close. Not if I didn’t want him banished</p>
<p>to hell. The more we fought, the easier it was to get swallowed</p>
<p>up in hatred and convince myself that he meant nothing to me,</p>
<p>and that I could move on without him.</p>
<p>“Take it back,” Patch said, his voice low.</p>
<p>I couldn’t bring myself to look at him, and I couldn’t bring</p>
<p>myself to take it back. I tipped my chin up and pinned my eyes</p>
<p>on the blur of rain over his shoulder. Damn my pride, and damn</p>
<p>his, too.</p>
<p>“Take it back, Nora,” Patch repeated more firmly.</p>
<p>“I can’t do the right thing with you in my life,” I said, hating</p>
<p>myself for allowing my chin to tremble. “This will be easier on</p>
<p>everyone if we just—I want a clean break. I’ve thought this</p>
<p>through.” I hadn’t. I hadn’t thought this through at all. I hadn’t</p>
<p>meant to say these words. But a small, horrible, and despicable</p>
<p>part of me wanted Patch to hurt as much as I was hurt. “I want</p>
<p>you out of my life.All the way.”</p>
<p>After a heavy beat of silence, Patch reached around me and</p>
<p>shoved something deep into the back pocket of my jeans. I</p>
<p>couldn’t tell whether I’d imagined that his hand had stayed there</p>
<p>a half beat longer than necessary.</p>
<p>“Cash,” he explained. “You’re going to need it.”</p>
<p>I dug the money out. “I don’t want your money.” When he</p>
<p>didn’t take the outstretched wad of cash, I slapped it against his</p>
<p>chest, meaning to brush past him as I did, but Patch caught my</p>
<p>hand, trapping it against his body.</p>
<p>“Take it.” The tone of his voice told me I knew nothing. I didn’t</p>
<p>understand him, or his world. I was a stranger, and I’d never fit</p>
<p>in. “Half the guys in there are carrying some form of weapon. If</p>
<p>anything happens, throw the money on the table and head for</p>
<p>the doors. Nobody’s going to follow you with a pile of cash up</p>
<p>for grabs.”</p>
<p>I remembered Marcie. Was he suggesting that someone</p>
<p>might try to knife me? I nearly laughed. Did he honestly think that</p>
<p>would scare me? Whether I wanted him as my guardian angel</p>
<p>was irrelevant. The fact of the matter was, nothing I said or did</p>
<p>would change his duty. He had to keep me safe. The fact that</p>
<p>he was here right now proved it.</p>
<p>He released my hand and tugged on the door handle, the</p>
<p>muscles along his arm rigid. The door closed behind him,</p>
<p>quaking on its hinges.</p><p>

<p></p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>I FOUND SCOTT LEANINGON HIS POOL STICKATATABLE near the front.</p>
<p>He was studying a spread of billiard balls when Iwalked up.</p>
<p>“Find an ATM?” I asked, tossing my damp jean jacket on a</p>
<p>metal folding chair pushed up against the wall.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but not before I swallowed ten gallons of rain.” He</p>
<p>lifted the Hawaiian hat and shook out the water for emphasis.</p>
<p>Maybe he’d found an ATM—but not until after he’d finished</p>
<p>whatever it was he’d been doing in the side alley. And as much</p>
<p>as I would have liked to know what that was, I probably wasn’t</p>
<p>going to find out any time soon. I’d missed my chance when</p>
<p>Patch had pulled me away to tell me Iwas in over my head here</p>
<p>at the Z and should run along home.</p>
<p>I spread my hands on the lip of the pool table and leaned in</p>
<p>casually, hoping I looked completely in my element, but the truth</p>
<p>was, my heart rate was high. Not only had I just come off a</p>
<p>confrontation with Patch, but no one in the near vicinity looked</p>
<p>remotely friendly. And try as I might, I couldn’t sweep away the</p>
<p>memory that someone had bled out on one of the tables. Was it</p>
<p>this one? I pushed up from the table and brushed my hands</p>
<p>clean.</p>
<p>“We’re just about to start a game,” Scott said. “Fifty dollars</p>
<p>and you’re in. Grab a cue.”</p>
<p>I wasn’t in the mood to play and would have preferred</p>
<p>watching, but a quick scan of the room revealed that Patch was</p>
<p>seated at a poker table in the back. Even though his body</p>
<p>wasn’t directly facing mine, I knew he was watching me. He was</p>
<p>watching everyone in the room. He never went anywhere without</p>
<p>making a careful and detailed assessment of his surroundings.</p>
<p>Knowing this, I tried on the most dazzling smile I had inside</p>
<p>me at the moment. “I’d love to.” I didn’t want Patch to know how</p>
<p>upset I was, how much I was hurting. I didn’t want him to think I</p>
<p>wasn’t having a good time with Scott.</p>
<p>But before I could head over to the rack, a short man in wire</p>
<p>glasses and a sweater vest came up beside Scott. Everything</p>
<p>about him looked out of place—he was groomed, his pants</p>
<p>were pressed, and his loafers were polished. He asked Scott in</p>
<p>a voice almost too muted to hear, “How much?”</p>
<p>“Fifty,” Scott answered with a touch of annoyance. “Same as</p>
<p>always.”</p>
<p>“The game has a hundred minimum.”</p>
<p>“Since when?”</p>
<p>“Let me rephrase. For you it has a hundred minimum.”</p>
<p>Scott went red in the face, reached for his drink on the</p>
<p>table’s edge, and tipped it back. Then he retrieved his wallet</p>
<p>and crammed a wad of cash into the front pocket of the man’s</p>
<p>shirt. “There’s fifty. I’ll pay the other half after the game. Now get</p>
<p>your bad breath out of my face so I can concentrate.”</p>
<p>The short man tapped a pencil against his bottom lip. “You’re</p>
<p>going to have to settle your account with Dew first. He’s getting</p>
<p>impatient. He’s been generous with you, and you haven’t</p>
<p>returned the favor.”</p>
<p>“Tell him I’ll have the money by the end of the night.”</p>
<p>“That line wore out its welcome a week ago.”</p>
<p>Scott stepped closer, crowding the man’s space. “I’m not the</p>
<p>only guy here who owes Dew a little.”</p>
<p>“But you’re the one he’s worried won’t pay him back.” The</p>
<p>short man pulled out the cash Scott had tucked in his pocket</p>
<p>and let the bills flutter to the ground. “Like I said, Dew’s getting</p>
<p>restless.” He gave Scott a meaningful raise of his eyebrows</p>
<p>and walked off.</p>
<p>“How much do you owe Dew?” I asked Scott.</p>
<p>He glared at me.</p>
<p>Okay, next question. “What’s the competition like?” I spoke in</p>
<p>hushed tones as I eyed the other players scattered around the</p>
<p>various pool tables. Two out of every three were smoking. Three</p>
<p>out of every three had tattoos of knives, guns, and various other</p>
<p>weaponry climbing their arms. Any other night and I might have</p>
<p>been scared, or at the very least uncomfortable, but Patch was</p>
<p>still in the corner.As long as he was here, I knew Iwas safe.</p>
<p>Scott snorted. “These guys are amateurs. I could beat them</p>
<p>on my worst day. My real competition is in there.” He shifted his</p>
<p>gaze toward a corridor that branched off from the main area.</p>
<p>The corridor was narrow and dim, and led to a room that</p>
<p>glowed a luminous orange. A curtain of beads hung across the</p>
<p>doorway. One intricately carved pool table sat just back from the</p>
<p>entrance.</p>
<p>entrance.</p>
<p>“That’s where the big money plays?” I guessed.</p>
<p>“Back there, I could make in one game what I make in fifteen</p>
<p>out here.”</p>
<p>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Patch’s gaze flick to me.</p>
<p>Pretending not to notice, I reached into my back pocket and</p>
<p>took a step closer to Scott. “You need a hundred total for the</p>
<p>next game, right? Here’s … fifty,” I said, quickly counting the two</p>
<p>twenties and ten Patch had given me. I wasn’t a big fan of</p>
<p>gambling, but Iwanted to prove to Patch that the Z wasn’t going</p>
<p>to eat me alive and spit me out. I could fit in. Or at least not get</p>
<p>pushed around.And if it looked like Iwas flirting with Scott in the</p>
<p>process, so be it. Screwyou, I thought across the room, even</p>
<p>though I knew Patch couldn’t hear me.</p>
<p>Scott looked between me and the money in my hand. “Is this</p>
<p>a joke?”</p>
<p>“If you win, we’ll split the profit.”</p>
<p>Scott considered the money with a lust that caught me off</p>
<p>guard. He needed the money. He wasn’t at the Z tonight for</p>
<p>entertainment. Gambling was an addiction.</p>
<p>He swiped the money and jogged over to the short man in</p>
<p>the sweater vest, whose pencil was furiously but meticulously</p>
<p>scribbling numbers and balances for the other players. I stole a</p>
<p>glance at Patch, to see his reaction to what I’d just done, but his</p>
<p>eyes were on the poker game, his expression undecipherable.</p>
<p>The man in the sweater vest counted Scott’s money, skillfully</p>
<p>lining up the bills so they all faced the same direction. When he</p>
<p>finished, he gave Scott a tight-lipped smile. It looked like we</p>
<p>were in.</p>
<p>Scott returned, chalking his pool stick. “You know what they</p>
<p>say about good luck. Got to kiss my cue.” He stuck it in my face.</p>
<p>I took a step back. “I’m not kissing your pool stick.”</p>
<p>Scott flapped his arms and playfully made chicken noises.</p>
<p>I glanced to the back of the hall, hoping to confirm that Patch</p>
<p>wasn’t watching the humiliating scene unfolding, and that was</p>
<p>when I saw Marcie Millar saunter up behind him, lean in, and</p>
<p>cross her arms around his neck.</p>
<p>My heart dropped to my knees.</p>
<p>Scott was speaking, tapping the pool stick against my</p>
<p>forehead, but the words went right past. I fought to recapture my</p>
<p>breath and focused on the blur of concrete straight ahead to</p>
<p>ground my complete shock and sense of betrayal. So this was</p>
<p>what he meant when he said things with Marcie were strictly</p>
<p>business? Because it sure didn’t look that way to me! And what</p>
<p>was she doing here after having just been knifed at Bo’s? Did</p>
<p>she feel safe because she was with Patch? On a split-second</p>
<p>thought, I wondered if he was doing this to make me jealous.</p>
<p>But if that were the case, he would have to have known I’d be at</p>
<p>the Z tonight. Which he couldn’t have, unless he’d been spying</p>
<p>on me. Had he been around more the past twenty-four hours</p>
<p>than I’d originally believed?</p>
<p>I dug my fingernails into the palms of my hands, struggling to</p>
<p>focus on the pain there, and not the choked, humiliated feeling</p>
<p>rising inside me. I stood that way, numb and holding in the threat</p>
<p>of tears, before my attention was pulled to the doorway leading</p>
<p>into the corridor. A guy in a red muscle tee leaned on the frame.</p>
<p>into the corridor. A guy in a red muscle tee leaned on the frame.</p>
<p>Something was wrong with a patch of skin at the base of his</p>
<p>throat—it almost looked deformed. Before I could take a closer</p>
<p>look, Iwas paralyzed by a flash of déjà vu. Something about him</p>
<p>was startlingly familiar, even though I knew we’d never met. I</p>
<p>had a strong urge to run, but at the same time was</p>
<p>overwhelmed by the need to place him.</p>
<p>He picked up the white cue ball from the table closest to him</p>
<p>and tossed it lazily a few times in the air.</p>
<p>“Come on,” Scott said, waving the pool stick back and forth</p>
<p>across my line of vision. The other guys surrounding the table</p>
<p>laughed. “Do it, Nora,” Scott said. “Just a little peck. For luck.”</p>
<p>He slipped the pool stick under the hem of my shirt and lifted</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>I slapped the pool stick away. “Knock it off.”</p>
<p>I saw movement from the guy in the red muscle tee. It</p>
<p>happened so fast it took two beats of my heart to realize what</p>
<p>was about to happen. He cranked his arm and hurled the cue</p>
<p>ball across the room. An instant later, the mirror hanging on the</p>
<p>far wall shattered, shards of glass raining to the floor.</p>
<p>The room fell silent except for the classic rock playing</p>
<p>through the speakers.</p>
<p>“You,” the guy in the red muscle tee said. He aimed a</p>
<p>handgun at the man in the sweater vest. “Give me the money.”</p>
<p>He motioned him closer with a flick of the gun. “Keep your</p>
<p>hands where I can see them.”</p>
<p>Beside me, Scott pushed forward to the front of the crowd.</p>
<p>“No way, man. That’s our money.” A few shouts of agreement</p>
<p>rose up from the room.</p>
<p>The guy in the red tee kept the gun trained on the man in the</p>
<p>sweater vest, but his eyes roved sideways to Scott. He grinned,</p>
<p>baring teeth. “Not anymore.”</p>
<p>“If you take that money, I’ll kill you.” There was a calm fury to</p>
<p>Scott’s voice. He sounded like he meant it. I stood frozen in</p>
<p>place, barely breathing, terrified of what might happen next,</p>
<p>because not one part of me doubted that the gun was loaded.</p>
<p>The gunman’s smile grew. “That so?”</p>
<p>“Nobody in here is going to let you leave with our money,”</p>
<p>Scott said. “Do yourself a favor and put the gun down.”</p>
<p>Another murmur of agreement circled the room.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the temperature in the room seemed to</p>
<p>be rising, the guy in the red muscle tee lazily scratched his neck</p>
<p>with the barrel of the gun. He didn’t appear the least bit worried.</p>
<p>“No.” Switching the gun to aim at Scott, he ordered, “Get on the</p>
<p>table.”</p>
<p>“Get lost.”</p>
<p>“Get on the table!”</p>
<p>The guy in the red tee was two-handing the gun, aiming at</p>
<p>Scott’s chest. Very slowly, Scott raised his hands level with his</p>
<p>shoulders and scooted backward onto the pool table. “You won’t</p>
<p>leave alive. You’re outnumbered thirty to one.”</p>
<p>The guy in the red tee crossed to Scott in three strides. He</p>
<p>stood directly in front of Scott for a moment, his finger poised</p>
<p>on the trigger. A bead of sweat trickled down the side of Scott’s</p>
<p>face. I couldn’t believe he didn’t wrench the gun away. Didn’t he</p>
<p>know he couldn’t die? Didn’t he know he was Nephilim? But</p>
<p>Patch had said he belonged to a Nephilim blood society—how</p>
<p>could he not know?</p>
<p>“You’re making a big mistake,” Scott said, his voice still cool,</p>
<p>but spilling the first drop of panic.</p>
<p>I wondered why nobody made a move to help him. As Scott</p>
<p>had pointed out, the crowd had the guy in the red tee</p>
<p>outnumbered by a landslide. But there was something vicious</p>
<p>and frighteningly powerful about him. Something …</p>
<p>otherworldly. Iwondered if they were just as spooked by him as I</p>
<p>was.</p>
<p>I also wondered if the queasy and uncomfortably familiar</p>
<p>feeling inside me meant he was a fallen angel. Or Nephilim.</p>
<p>Out of all the faces in the crowd, I suddenly found myself</p>
<p>locking eyes with Marcie. She stood across the crowd, with</p>
<p>something I could only describe as bewildered fascination</p>
<p>written all over her expression. I knew, right then, that she had</p>
<p>no idea what was about to happen. She didn’t realize Scott was</p>
<p>Nephilim and had more strength in one of his hands than a</p>
<p>human had in his whole body. She hadn’t seen Chauncey, the</p>
<p>first Nephil I’d ever met, mangle my cell phone in the palm of his</p>
<p>hand. She hadn’t been there the night he’d chased me through</p>
<p>the halls of the high school. And the guy in the red muscle tee?</p>
<p>Whether Nephilim or fallen angel, he was likely just as powerful. Whatever was about to happen, it wasn’t a mere fistfight.</p>
<p>She should have learned her lesson at Bo’s and stayed</p>
<p>home.And so should have I.</p>
<p>The guy in the red tee shoved Scott with the gun, and he flew</p>
<p>The guy in the red tee shoved Scott with the gun, and he flew</p>
<p>back on the tabletop. Out of surprise or fear, Scott fumbled his</p>
<p>pool stick, and the guy in the red tee snatched it up. Without</p>
<p>pausing, he leaped onto the table and held the pool stick</p>
<p>pointed down at Scott’s face. He drilled the stick into the table</p>
<p>an inch from Scott’s ear. The pool stick went down with such</p>
<p>force, it smashed through the felt surface. Twelve inches of it</p>
<p>were visible beneath the table.</p>
<p>I swallowed a scream.</p>
<p>Scott’s Adam’s apple quivered. “You’re crazy, man,” he said.</p>
<p>Suddenly a bar stool flew through the air, knocking the guy in</p>
<p>the red tee sideways. He caught his balance but had to jump off</p>
<p>the table to keep it.</p>
<p>“Get him!” someone in the crowd shouted.</p>
<p>Something like a war cry went up, and more people grabbed</p>
<p>for bar stools. I went down on my hands and knees and looked</p>
<p>through the forest of legs for the nearest exit. A few bodies</p>
<p>away there was a guy with a gun holstered in an ankle strap. He</p>
<p>reached for it, and a moment later the splintering sound of shots</p>
<p>rang out. What followed was not silence, but more mayhem:</p>
<p>swearing, shouting, and fists hammering into flesh. I got to my</p>
<p>feet and ran in a crouch toward the back door.</p>
<p>I’d just slipped through the exit when someone hooked the</p>
<p>waistband of my jeans and hauled me upright. Patch.</p>
<p>“Take the Jeep,” he ordered, shoving his car keys into my</p>
<p>hand.A hasty pause. “What are you waiting for?”</p>
<p>My eyes teared up, but I angrily blinked them away. “Quit</p>
<p>acting like I’m a huge inconvenience! I never asked for your</p>
<p>help!”</p>
<p>“I told you not to come tonight. You wouldn’t be an</p>
<p>inconvenience if you’d listened. This isn’t your world—it’s mine.</p>
<p>You’re so bent on proving you can handle it that you’re going to</p>
<p>do something stupid and get yourself killed.”</p>
<p>Iresented that, and opened my mouth to say so.</p>
<p>“The guy in the red shirt is Nephilim,” Patch said, cutting me</p>
<p>out of the conversation. “The branding mark means he’s in</p>
<p>deep with the blood society I told you about earlier. He’s sworn</p>
<p>allegiance to them.”</p>
<p>“Branding mark?”</p>
<p>“Near his collarbone.”</p>
<p>The deformity was from a branding? I shifted my eyes to the</p>
<p>small window set in the door. Inside, bodies swarmed over the</p>
<p>pool tables, punches being thrown in every direction. I didn’t</p>
<p>see the guy in the red tee anymore, but now I understood why I’d</p>
<p>recognized him. He was Nephilim. He’d reminded me of</p>
<p>Chauncey in a way Scott hadn’t even come close to. Iwondered</p>
<p>if this could somehow mean that, like Chauncey, he was evil.</p>
<p>And Scott was not.</p>
<p>A loud noise seemed to rupture my eardrums, and Patch</p>
<p>yanked me to the ground. Fragments of glass hailed down</p>
<p>around us. The window in the back door had been shot out.</p>
<p>“Get out of here,” Patch said, pushing me in the direction of</p>
<p>the street.</p>
<p>I turned back. “Where are you going?”</p>
<p>“Marcie’s still inside. I’ll get a ride with her.”</p>
<p>My lungs seemed to lock, no air going in or out. “What about</p>
<p>me? You’re my guardian angel.”</p>
<p>Patch sliced his eyes into mine. “Not anymore, Angel.”</p>
<p>Before I could argue back, he slipped through the door,</p>
<p>vanishing into the mayhem.</p>
<p>Out on the street, I unlocked the Jeep, jerked the seat</p>
<p>forward, and floored it out of the parking space. He wasn’t my</p>
<p>guardian angel anymore? Was he serious? All because I’d told</p>
<p>him that’s how I wanted it? Or had he said it to scare me? To</p>
<p>make me regret saying I didn’t want him? Well, if he wasn’t my</p>
<p>guardian, it was because I was trying to do the right thing! I was</p>
<p>trying to make this easier on both of us. Iwas trying to keep him</p>
<p>safe from the archangels. I’d told him exactly why I’d done it,</p>
<p>and he was hanging it over my head, as if this whole mess was</p>
<p>somehow my fault. As if this was what I wanted! This was more</p>
<p>his fault than mine. I had the urge to run back and tell him Iwasn’</p>
<p>t helpless. I wasn’t a pawn in his big, bad world. And I wasn’t</p>
<p>blind. I could see well enough to know something was going on</p>
<p>between him and Marcie. In fact, I was now all but certain</p>
<p>something was. Forget it. I was better off without him. He was</p>
<p>slime. A jerk. An untrustworthy jerk. I didn’t need him—for</p>
<p>anything.</p>
<p>I rolled the Jeep to a stop in front of the farmhouse. My legs</p>
<p>were still trembling, and my breath rattled a little when I exhaled.</p>
<p>I was acutely aware of the quiet all around. The Jeep had</p>
<p>always been a place of refuge; tonight it felt foreign and</p>
<p>isolated, and far too big for just one person. I lowered my head</p>
<p>onto the steering wheel and cried. I didn’t think about Patch</p>
<p>driving Marcie home in her car—I just let the hot air from the</p>
<p>vents rush over my skin and breathed in the scent of Patch.</p>
<p>I sat that way, hunched and sobbing, until the needle on the</p>
<p>gas gauge dropped half a bar. I dabbed my eyes dry and let go</p>
<p>of a long, troubled sigh. I was just about to shut off the engine</p>
<p>when I saw Patch standing on the porch, leaning on one of the</p>
<p>support beams.</p>
<p>For a moment I thought he’d come to check on me, and tears</p>
<p>of relief sprang to my eyes. But I was driving his Jeep. He’d</p>
<p>most likely come to take it back. After the way he’d treated me</p>
<p>tonight, I couldn’t believe there was any other reason.</p>
<p>He walked down the driveway and opened the driver’s-side</p>
<p>door. “You okay?”</p>
<p>I nodded stiffly. I would have said yes, but my voice was still</p>
<p>hiding out in the vicinity of my stomach. The cold-eyed Nephil</p>
<p>was fresh in my thoughts, and I couldn’t stop wondering what</p>
<p>had happened after I left the Z. Had Scott gotten out? Had</p>
<p>Marcie?</p>
<p>Of course she had. Patch had seemed bent on making sure</p>
<p>of it.</p>
<p>“Why did the Nephil in the red shirt want money?” I asked,</p>
<p>climbing sideways into the passenger seat. It was still</p>
<p>sprinkling, and even though I knew Patch couldn’t feel the damp</p>
<p>chill of the rain, it felt somehow wrong to leave him standing in it.</p>
<p>After a count, he got behind the wheel, closing us into the</p>
<p>Jeep together. Two nights ago the gesture would have felt</p>
<p>Jeep together. Two nights ago the gesture would have felt</p>
<p>intimate. Now it just felt tense and awkward. “He was fundraising</p>
<p>for the Nephilim blood society. I wish I had a better idea</p>
<p>of what they’re planning. If they need money, it’s most likely for</p>
<p>resources. Either that, or to buy off fallen angels. But how, who,</p>
<p>and why, I don’t know.” He shook his head. “I need someone on</p>
<p>the inside. For the first time, being an angel puts me at a</p>
<p>disadvantage. They’re not going to let me within a mile of the</p>
<p>operation.”</p>
<p>For a split second it occurred to me that he could be asking</p>
<p>for my help, but I was hardly Nephilim. I had an infinitesimal</p>
<p>amount of Nephilim blood running through my veins that could</p>
<p>be traced back over four hundred years to my Nephilim</p>
<p>ancestor, Chauncey Langeais. For all intents and purposes, I</p>
<p>was human. Iwasn’t getting on the inside any faster than Patch.</p>
<p>I said, “You said Scott and the Nephil in the red shirt are both</p>
<p>part of the blood society, but they didn’t seem to know each</p>
<p>other.Are you sure Scott’s involved?”</p>
<p>“He’s involved.”</p>
<p>“Then how could they not know each other?”</p>
<p>“My best guess right now is that whoever’s running the</p>
<p>society is separating the individual members to keep them in</p>
<p>the dark. Without solidarity, the chances of a coup are low. More</p>
<p>than that, if they don’t know how strong they are, the Nephilim</p>
<p>can’t leak that information to the enemy. Fallen angels can’t get</p>
<p>information if the society members themselves know nothing.”</p>
<p>Digesting this, I wasn’t sure whose side I was on. Part of me</p>
<p>abhorred the idea of fallen angels possessing the bodies of</p>
<p>Nephilim every Cheshvan. A less noble part of me was grateful</p>
<p>they were targeting Nephilim and not humans. Not me. Not</p>
<p>anyone I loved.</p>
<p>“And Marcie?” I said, trying to keep my voice neutral.</p>
<p>“She likes poker,” Patch said noncommittally. He put the</p>
<p>Jeep in reverse. “I should be going. You going to be okay</p>
<p>tonight? Is your mom gone?”</p>
<p>I turned in the seat to face him. “Marcie had her arms around</p>
<p>you.”</p>
<p>“Marcie’s sense of personal space is nonexistent.”</p>
<p>“So you’re an expert on Marcie now?”</p>
<p>His eyes darkened, and I knew I wasn’t supposed to go</p>
<p>there, but I didn’t care. I was so going there. “What’s going on</p>
<p>between the two of you? What I saw didn’t look like business.”</p>
<p>“I was in the middle of a game when she came up behind</p>
<p>me. It’s not the first time a girl has done that, and it probably</p>
<p>won’t be the last.”</p>
<p>“You could have pushed her away.”</p>
<p>“She had her arms around me one moment, and the next</p>
<p>moment the Nephil threw the cue ball. I wasn’t thinking about</p>
<p>Marcie. I ran outside to check the perimeter in case he wasn’t</p>
<p>alone.”</p>
<p>“You went back for her.”</p>
<p>“Iwasn’t going to leave her there.”</p>
<p>I stayed in my seat a moment, the knot in my stomach so</p>
<p>tight it hurt. What was I supposed to think? Had he gone back</p>
<p>for Marcie out of courtesy? A sense of duty? Or something</p>
<p>entirely different, and much more worrisome?</p>
<p>“I had a dream about Marcie’s dad last night.” I wasn’t even</p>
<p>sure why I’d said it. Possibly to communicate to Patch that my</p>
<p>pain was so raw it had even entered my dreams. I’d once read</p>
<p>that dreams are a way of reconciling what’s happening in our</p>
<p>lives, and if that was true, my dream was definitely telling me I</p>
<p>hadn’t come to terms with whatever was going on between</p>
<p>Patch and Marcie. Not if I was dreaming about fallen angels</p>
<p>and Cheshvan. Not if Iwas dreaming about Marcie’s father.</p>
<p>“You dreamed about Marcie’s dad?” Patch’s voice was as</p>
<p>calm as ever, but something in the way he looked sharply at me</p>
<p>made me think he was surprised by this news. Maybe even</p>
<p>disconcerted.</p>
<p>“I think I was in England. A long time ago. Marcie’s dad was</p>
<p>being chased through a forest. Only he couldn’t get away,</p>
<p>because his cape got tangled in the trees. He kept saying a</p>
<p>fallen angel was trying to possess him.”</p>
<p>Patch pondered this a moment. Once again, his silence told</p>
<p>me I’d said something that interested him. But I couldn’t guess</p>
<p>what.</p>
<p>He glanced at his watch. “Need me to walk through the</p>
<p>house?”</p>
<p>I gazed up at the dark, vacant windows of the farmhouse. The</p>
<p>combination of nightfall and drizzling rain cast a gloomy,</p>
<p>uninviting feeling all around. I couldn’t tell which was less</p>
<p>appealing: going inside alone, or sitting out here with Patch,</p>
<p>scared he might be moving on. To Marcie Millar.</p>
<p>“I’m hesitating because I don’t want to get wet. Besides, you</p>
<p>“I’m hesitating because I don’t want to get wet. Besides, you</p>
<p>obviously have somewhere to be.” I pushed on the door and</p>
<p>swung one leg out. “That, and our relationship is over. You don’t</p>
<p>owe me any favors.” We locked eyes.</p>
<p>I’d said it to hurt him, but I was the one with the lump in my</p>
<p>throat. Before I could say something that would slice deeper, I</p>
<p>dashed for the porch, holding my arms over my head to shield</p>
<p>my hair from the rain.</p>
<p>Inside, I leaned against the front door and listened to Patch</p>
<p>drive away. My vision smeared with tears, and I closed my eyes.</p>
<p>I wished Patch would come back. I wanted him here. I wanted</p>
<p>him to pull me against him and kiss away the cold, empty</p>
<p>feeling slowly freezing me from the inside out. But the sound of</p>
<p>tires skimming over the wet road outside never came. Without warning, the unbidden memory of our last night</p>
<p>together before everything collapsed drifted up from my</p>
<p>memory. I automatically started to block it. The trouble was, I</p>
<p>wanted to remember. I needed some way to still have Patch</p>
<p>close. Dropping my guard, I let myself feel his mouth on mine.</p>
<p>Light at first, then more serious. I felt his body, warm and solid,</p>
<p>against mine. His hands were at the nape of my neck, fastening</p>
<p>his silver chain. He promised to love me forever….</p>
<p>I turned the deadbolt, dissolving the memory with a click.</p>
<p>Screw. Him. I’d keep saying the words as many times as it took.</p>
<p>In the kitchen, the lights answered at the flip of a switch, and I</p>
<p>was relieved to find the electricity up and running. The phone</p>
<p>was blinking red, and I played the messages.</p>
<p>“Nora,” my mom’s voice said, “we’re getting tons of rain here</p>
<p>in Boston, and they’ve decided to reschedule the rest of the</p>
<p>auctions. I’m headed home and should be there by eleven. You</p>
<p>can send Vee home if you’d like. Love you and see you soon.”</p>
<p>I checked the clock. It was a few minutes before ten. I had</p>
<p>only one more hour alone.</p><p>

<p></p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>THE FOLLOWING MORNING, I DRAGGED MYSELF OUT of bed, and after</p>
<p>a quick stint in the bathroom that included dabbing on undereye</p>
<p>concealer and spritzing my hair with curl revitalizer, I</p>
<p>moseyed into the kitchen to find my mom already seated at the</p>
<p>table. She had a mug of herbal tea between her hands, and her</p>
<p>hair had a tousled, slept-on look, which was a nice way of</p>
<p>saying she looked like a porcupine. Glancing at me over the top</p>
<p>of her mug, she smiled. “Morning.”</p>
<p>I slid into the seat opposite and shook shredded wheat into a</p>
<p>bowl. My mom had set out strawberries and a small pitcher of</p>
<p>milk, and I added both to the cereal. I tried to be conscientious</p>
<p>about what I ate, but it always seemed much easier when my</p>
<p>mom was home, making sure meals amounted to more than</p>
<p>whatever I could grab in ten seconds.</p>
<p>“Sleep well?” she asked.</p>
<p>I nodded, having just eaten a spoonful of cereal.</p>
<p>“I forgot to ask last night,” Mom said. “Did you end up taking</p>
<p>Scott on a tour of town?”</p>
<p>“I canceled.” Probably best to leave it at that. I wasn’t sure</p>
<p>how she’d react if she found out I’d tailed him to the pier, then</p>
<p>spent the evening with him at a dive of a pool hall in Springvale.</p>
<p>Mom’s nose wrinkled. “Is that … smoke I smell?”</p>
<p>Oh shoot.</p>
<p>“I lit some candles in my room this morning,” I said, regretting</p>
<p>that I hadn’t taken the time to shower. I was sure the Z lingered</p>
<p>in my clothes, my sheets, my hair.</p>
<p>She frowned. “That’s definitely smoke I smell.” Her chair</p>
<p>scraped back, and she started to stand, on her way over to</p>
<p>investigate.</p>
<p>No use stalling now. I scratched my eyebrow nervously. “I sort</p>
<p>of went to a pool hall last night.”</p>
<p>“Patch?” We’d settled on a rule not too long ago that I was</p>
<p>absolutely not, under any circumstances, allowed to go out with</p>
<p>Patch while my mom was away.</p>
<p>“He was there, yes.”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t go with Patch. I went with Scott.” By the look on her</p>
<p>face, Iwas pretty sure this was worse. “But before you blow up,”</p>
<p>I rushed on, “I just want to say that my curiosity is killing me. I’m</p>
<p>having a really hard time ignoring the fact that the Parnells are</p>
<p>doing everything possible to keep Scott’s past in the dark. Why</p>
<p>is it that every time Mrs. Parnell opens her mouth, Scott is two</p>
<p>inches away, watching her like a hawk? What could he have</p>
<p>done that was so bad?”</p>
<p>I expected my mom to jump to her feet and tell me that</p>
<p>starting the minute I got home from school this afternoon, I was</p>
<p>grounded until the Fourth of July, but she said, “I noticed that</p>
<p>too.”</p>
<p>“Is it just me, or does she seem scared of him?” I continued,</p>
<p>“Is it just me, or does she seem scared of him?” I continued,</p>
<p>relieved that she appeared more interested in discussing Scott</p>
<p>than my punishment for spending the evening at a sketchy pool</p>
<p>hall.</p>
<p>“What kind of mother is scared of her own son?” Mom</p>
<p>wondered aloud.</p>
<p>“I think she knows his secret. She knows what he did. And he</p>
<p>knows that she knows.” Maybe Scott’s secret was simply that</p>
<p>he was Nephilim, but I didn’t think so. Based on his reaction last</p>
<p>night when he’d been attacked by the red-shirted Nephil, I was</p>
<p>beginning to suspect he didn’t know the truth about who he was,</p>
<p>or what he was capable of. He might have noticed his</p>
<p>incredible strength or his ability to speak to people’s thoughts,</p>
<p>but he probably didn’t know how to explain it. But if Scott and</p>
<p>his mom weren’t trying to hide his Nephilim heritage, what were</p>
<p>they trying to hide? What had he done that needed so much</p>
<p>covering up?</p>
<p>Thirty minutes later, I strolled into chemistry to find Marcie</p>
<p>already at our desk, talking on her cell phone, completely</p>
<p>ignoring the sign on the whiteboard that read NO CELL PHONES,</p>
<p>NO EXCEPTIONS. When she saw me, she gave me her back and</p>
<p>cupped a hand over her mouth, clearly wanting privacy. Like I</p>
<p>cared. By the time I made it to our desk, the only part of the</p>
<p>conversation I picked up was a seductive, “Love you, too.”</p>
<p>She slipped her cell inside a pouch at the front of her</p>
<p>backpack and smiled at me. “My boyfriend. He doesn’t go to</p>
<p>high school.”</p>
<p>I immediately had a moment of self-doubt and wondered if</p>
<p>Patch was on the other end of the line, but he had sworn that</p>
<p>what happened between him and Marcie last night meant</p>
<p>nothing. I could either stir myself into a jealous frenzy, or I could</p>
<p>believe him. I nodded sympathetically. “Must be hard dating a</p>
<p>dropout.”</p>
<p>“Ha, ha. Just so you know, I’m sending out a text after class</p>
<p>to everyone who’s invited to my annual summer party Tuesday</p>
<p>night. You’re on the list,” she said casually. “Missing my party is</p>
<p>the surest way to sabotage your social life … not that you have</p>
<p>to worry about sabotaging something you don’t have.”</p>
<p>“Annual summer party? Never heard of it.”</p>
<p>She retrieved a makeup compact, which had worn a circle</p>
<p>into the back pocket of her jeans, and dabbed pressed powder</p>
<p>on her nose. “That’s because you’ve never been invited before.”</p>
<p>Okay, hold on. Why was Marcie inviting me? Even though my</p>
<p>IQ was double hers, she had to have noticed the frost between</p>
<p>us. That, and we didn’t share any common friends. Or interests,</p>
<p>for that matter. “Wow, Marcie. That’s really nice of you to invite</p>
<p>me. A little unexpected, but still nice. I’ll definitely try to make it.”</p>
<p>But not very hard.</p>
<p>Marcie bent toward me. “I saw you last night.”</p>
<p>My heart beat slightly faster, but I managed to hold my voice</p>
<p>level. Noncommittal, even. “Yeah, I saw you, too.”</p>
<p>“That was kind of … crazy.” She left her statement openended,</p>
<p>as if she wanted me to elaborate for her.</p>
<p>“I guess.”</p>
<p>“You guess? Did you see the pool stick? I’ve never seen</p>
<p>anyone do that before. He shoved it through the pool table.</p>
<p>Aren’t those things made of slate?”</p>
<p>“I was at the back of the crowd. I couldn’t see much. Sorry.” I</p>
<p>wasn’t trying to be unhelpful on purpose; this was just one</p>
<p>discussion I didn’t want to have. And was this why she was</p>
<p>inviting me to her party? To instill a sense of trust and friendship</p>
<p>into our relationship, so that I’d tell her what, if anything, I knew</p>
<p>about what happened last night?</p>
<p>“You didn’t see anything?” Marcie repeated, a line of doubt</p>
<p>creasing her forehead.</p>
<p>“No. Did you study for today’s quiz? I have most of the</p>
<p>periodic table memorized, but the bottom row keeps tripping</p>
<p>me up.”</p>
<p>“Did Patch ever take you to play pool there? Did you ever</p>
<p>see anything like that before?”</p>
<p>Ignoring her, I flipped open my textbook.</p>
<p>“I heard you and Patch broke up,” she said, trying a new</p>
<p>angle.</p>
<p>I sucked in some air, but a little too late, since my face</p>
<p>already felt hot.</p>
<p>“Who called things off?” Marcie asked.</p>
<p>“Does it matter?”</p>
<p>Marcie scowled. “You know what? If you’re not going to talk,</p>
<p>you can forget coming to my party.”</p>
<p>“Iwasn’t going anyway.”</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes. “Are you mad because I was with Patch</p>
<p>at the Z last night? Because he doesn’t mean anything to me. We’re just having fun. It’s nothing serious.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it really looked that way,” I said, letting just enough</p>
<p>cynicism seep into my tone.</p>
<p>“Don’t be jealous, Nora. Patch and I are just really, really</p>
<p>good friends. But in case you’re interested, my mom knows a</p>
<p>really good relationship therapist. Let me know if you need a</p>
<p>referral. On second thought, she’s pretty pricey. I mean, I know</p>
<p>your mom has this stellar job and all—”</p>
<p>“Question for you, Marcie.” My voice was a cool warning, but</p>
<p>my hands were shaking in my lap. “What would you do if you</p>
<p>woke up tomorrow to find your dad had been murdered? Do</p>
<p>you think your mom’s part-time job at JC Penney would pay the</p>
<p>bills? Next time, before you bring up my family situation, put</p>
<p>yourself in my shoes for a minute. One teeny tiny minute.”</p>
<p>She held my gaze a long moment, but her expression was so</p>
<p>impassive I doubted I’d made her think twice. The only person</p>
<p>Marcie could ever empathize with was herself.</p>
<p>After class, I found Vee in the parking lot. She was splayed</p>
<p>across the hood of the Neon, sleeves rolled above her</p>
<p>shoulders, tanning. “We need to talk,” she said as I</p>
<p>approached. She pulled herself up to sitting and lowered her</p>
<p>sunglasses down her nose far enough to make eye contact.</p>
<p>“You and Patch are Splitsville, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>I climbed onto the hood beside her. “Who told?”</p>
<p>“Rixon. For the record, that hurt. I’m your best friend, and I</p>
<p>shouldn’t have to find these things out through the friend of a</p>
<p>friend. Or through the friend of an ex-boyfriend,” she added,</p>
<p>after thinking it all through. She laid a hand on my shoulder and</p>
<p>squeezed. “How are you holding up?”</p>
<p>Not especially well. But it was one of those things Iwas trying</p>
<p>to bury at the bottom of my heart, and I couldn’t keep it buried if I</p>
<p>talked about it. I eased back against the windshield, raising my</p>
<p>notebook to shield the sun. “You know what the worst part is?”</p>
<p>“That I was right all along and now you have to suffer through</p>
<p>hearing me say, ‘I told you so’?”</p>
<p>“Funny.”</p>
<p>“It’s no secret Patch is trouble. He’s got the whole bad-boyin-need-of-redemption</p>
<p>thing going on, but the catch is, most</p>
<p>bad boys don’t want redemption. They like being bad. They like</p>
<p>the power they get from striking fear and panic into the hearts of</p>
<p>mothers everywhere.”</p>
<p>“That was … insightful.”</p>
<p>“Anytime, babe.And what’s more—”</p>
<p>“Vee.”</p>
<p>She flapped her arms. “Hear me out. I’m saving the best for</p>
<p>last. I think this is the time to rethink your priorities when it</p>
<p>comes to guys. What we need is to find you a nice Boy Scout</p>
<p>who’ll make you appreciate the value of having a good man in</p>
<p>your life. Take Rixon, for example.”</p>
<p>I nailed her with a You’ve got to be kidding look.</p>
<p>“I resent that look,” Vee said. “Rixon happens to be a really</p>
<p>decent guy.”</p>
<p>We stared at each other for three more counts.</p>
<p>“Okay, so maybe Boy Scout is stretching it,” Vee said. “But</p>
<p>the point of all this is that you could benefit from a nice guy, a</p>
<p>guy whose closet isn’t solely black. What’s up with that,</p>
<p>anyway? Does Patch think he’s a commando?”</p>
<p>“I saw Marcie and Patch together last night,” I said on a sigh.</p>
<p>There. It was out.</p>
<p>Vee blinked a few times, digesting this. “What?” she said,</p>
<p>her jaw going slack.</p>
<p>I nodded. “I saw them. She had her arms wrapped around</p>
<p>him. They were together at a pool hall in Springvale.”</p>
<p>“You followed them?”</p>
<p>I wanted to say, Give me some credit, but managed only a</p>
<p>flat, “Scott invited me to play pool. I went with him, and we ran</p>
<p>into them there.” I wanted to tell Vee everything that had</p>
<p>happened after that moment, but as with Marcie, there were</p>
<p>some things I couldn’t explain to her. How was I supposed to tell</p>
<p>her about the Nephil in the red shirt, or how he’d rammed a pool</p>
<p>stick through the table?</p>
<p>Vee looked like she was scrambling for a response. “Well.</p>
<p>Like I was saying, once you see the light, you’ll never turn back.</p>
<p>Maybe Rixon has a friend. Other than Patch, that is …” She</p>
<p>trailed off awkwardly.</p>
<p>“I don’t need a boyfriend. I need a job.”</p>
<p>Vee did a full-on grimace. “More job talk, ugh. I just don’t get</p>
<p>the allure.”</p>
<p>“I need a car, and in order to get one, I need money. Hence</p>
<p>the job.” I had a running list of reasons to buy the Volkswagen</p>
<p>Cabriolet lined up in my mind: The car was small, and therefore</p>
<p>easy to park, and it was fuel efficient—a bonus, considering I</p>
<p>wasn’t going to have much money for gas after forking over a</p>
<p>thousand dollars for the car itself. And while I knew it was</p>
<p>ridiculous to feel a connection to something as inanimate and</p>
<p>practical as a car, I was beginning to view it as a metaphor of</p>
<p>change in my life. Freedom to go wherever I wanted, whenever.</p>
<p>Freedom to start fresh. Freedom from Patch, and all the</p>
<p>memories we shared that I hadn’t yet figured out how to slam</p>
<p>the door on.</p>
<p>“My mom is friends with one of the night managers at Enzo’s,</p>
<p>and they’re looking for baristas,” Vee suggested.</p>
<p>“I don’t know anything about being a barista.”</p>
<p>Vee shrugged. “You make coffee. You pour it. You carry it to</p>
<p>the eager little customers. How hard could it be?”</p>
<p>Forty-five minutes later, Vee and Iwere at the shore, walking the</p>
<p>boardwalk, putting off our homework and noncommittally</p>
<p>glancing in storefront windows. Since neither of us had a job,</p>
<p>and consequently no money, we were brushing up on our</p>
<p>window-shopping skills. We reached the end of the walk and</p>
<p>our eyes fell on a bakery. I could practically hear Vee’s mouth</p>
<p>watering as she pressed her face to the glass and gazed in at</p>
<p>the doughnut case.</p>
<p>“I think it’s been a whole hour since I last ate,” she said.</p>
<p>“Glazed doughnuts, here we come, my treat.” She was four</p>
<p>steps ahead, tugging on the doors.</p>
<p>“I thought you were trying to lose weight for swimsuit season.</p>
<p>I thought you were big-boned and wanted to even things out with</p>
<p>Rixon.”</p>
<p>“You sure know how to ruin the mood.Anyway, how’s one little</p>
<p>doughnut going to hurt?”</p>
<p>I had never seen Vee eat just one doughnut, but I kept my</p>
<p>mouth shut. We placed an order for a half-dozen glazed and had just</p>
<p>taken a seat at a table near the windows, when I saw Scott on</p>
<p>the other side of the glass. He had his forehead mashed</p>
<p>against the window and he was smiling. At me. Startled, I</p>
<p>jumped an inch. He crooked a finger, beckoning me outside.</p>
<p>“I’ll be right back,” I told Vee.</p>
<p>She followed my gaze. “Isn’t that Scotty the Hottie?”</p>
<p>“Stop calling him that. What happened to Scotty the Potty?”</p>
<p>“He grew up. What does he want to talk to you for?”</p>
<p>Something of a revelation crossed her face. “Oh, no you don’t.</p>
<p>You are not allowed to play rebound with him. He’s trouble—you</p>
<p>said so yourself. We’re going to find you a nice Boy Scout,</p>
<p>remember?”</p>
<p>I hooked my handbag over my shoulder. “I’m not playing</p>
<p>rebound. What?” I said in response to the look she was giving</p>
<p>me. “You expect me to just sit here and ignore him?”</p>
<p>She flipped her palms up. “Just hurry up or your doughnut is</p>
<p>going to make the endangered species list.”</p>
<p>Outside, I rounded the corner and walked back to where I’d</p>
<p>last seen Scott. He was lounging against the seat back of a</p>
<p>last seen Scott. He was lounging against the seat back of a</p>
<p>sidewalk bench, thumbs slung in his pockets. “You survive last</p>
<p>night?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I’m still here, aren’t I?”</p>
<p>He smiled. “A little more excitement than you’re used to?”</p>
<p>I didn’t remind him that he was the one who’d been stretched</p>
<p>out on the pool table with a pool stick drilled one inch from his</p>
<p>ear.</p>
<p>“Sorry I left you hanging,” Scott said. “Looks like you found</p>
<p>your own ride home?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it,” I said testily, not going to the trouble of</p>
<p>hiding my annoyance. “It just taught me never to go out with you</p>
<p>again.”</p>
<p>“I’ll make it up to you. Got time for a quick bite?” He hitched</p>
<p>his thumb toward a touristy restaurant down the boardwalk.</p>
<p>Alfeo’s. I’d eaten there years ago with my dad and remembered</p>
<p>the menu as pricey. The only thing I was going to get for under</p>
<p>five dollars was water. A Coke if I was lucky. Taking into</p>
<p>consideration the exorbitant prices and the company—after all,</p>
<p>my last memory of Scott was of him trying to tease my shirt up</p>
<p>with a pool stick—I wanted nothing more than to go finish my</p>
<p>doughnut.</p>
<p>“Can’t. I’m here with Vee,” I told Scott. “What happened at the</p>
<p>Z last night? After I left.”</p>
<p>“I got my money back.” Something about the way he said it</p>
<p>left me thinking it hadn’t been quite that simple.</p>
<p>“Our money,” I corrected.</p>
<p>“I’ve got your half at home,” he said vaguely. “I’ll drop it by</p>
<p>tonight.”</p>
<p>Yeah, right. I had a feeling he’d already blown all the money,</p>
<p>and then some.</p>
<p>“And the guy in the red shirt?” I asked.</p>
<p>“He got away.”</p>
<p>“He seemed really strong. Did he seem that way to you?</p>
<p>Something about him was … different.”</p>
<p>I was testing him, trying to figure out how much he knew, but</p>
<p>his only comment was a distracted, “Yeah, I guess. So, my mom</p>
<p>keeps harping on me to get out there and make new friends. No</p>
<p>offense, Grey, but you’re not one of the guys. Sooner or later I’m</p>
<p>going to have to branch out. Aw, don’t cry. Just remember all the</p>
<p>happy moments we’ve shared together, and I’m sure you’ll be</p>
<p>comforted.”</p>
<p>“You dragged me out here to break off our friendship? How</p>
<p>did I get so lucky?”</p>
<p>Scott laughed. “I thought I’d start with your boyfriend. He got a</p>
<p>name? I’m beginning to think he’s your imaginary friend. Imean,</p>
<p>I never see the two of you together.”</p>
<p>“We broke up.”</p>
<p>Something that resembled a twisted smile crept over his</p>
<p>face. “Yeah, that’s what I heard, but I wanted to see if you’d cop</p>
<p>to it.”</p>
<p>“You heard about me and Patch?”</p>
<p>“Some hot chick named Marcie told me. I ran into her at the</p>
<p>gas station, and she made sure to come over and introduce</p>
<p>herself. By the way, she said you’re a loser.”</p>
<p>“Marcie told you about me and Patch?” My spine stiffened.</p>
<p>“Marcie told you about me and Patch?” My spine stiffened.</p>
<p>“Want some advice? Some genuine guy-to-girl advice?</p>
<p>Forget Patch. Move on. Find some guy who’s into the same</p>
<p>stuff you are. Studying, chess, collecting and classifying dead</p>
<p>bugs … and give some serious thought to dying your hair.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>Scott coughed into his fist, but I didn’t miss that it was to</p>
<p>cover up a smile. “Let’s be honest. Redheads are a liability.”</p>
<p>I narrowed my eyes. “I don’t have red hair.”</p>
<p>He was full-on grinning. “Could be worse. Could be orange. Wicked-witch orange.”</p>
<p>“Are you this big of a jerk to everyone? Because this is why</p>
<p>you don’t have friends.”</p>
<p>“A little rough around the edges is all.”</p>
<p>I pushed my sunglasses to the top of my head and made</p>
<p>direct eye contact. “For the record, I don’t play chess and I don’t</p>
<p>collect insects.”</p>
<p>“But you study. I know you do. I know the type. The hallmark</p>
<p>of your entire persona is defined by two words. Anal retentive.</p>
<p>You’re just another standard OCD case.”</p>
<p>My mouth fell open. “Okay, so maybe I study a little. But I’m</p>
<p>not boring—not that boring.” At least, I hoped not. “Obviously</p>
<p>you don’t know me at all.”</p>
<p>“Riiiiight.”</p>
<p>“Fine,” I said defensively. “What’s something you’re</p>
<p>interested in that you think I’d never go for? Stop laughing. I’m</p>
<p>serious. Name one thing.”</p>
<p>Scott scratched his ear. “Ever gone to battle of the bands?</p>
<p>Loud, unrehearsed music. Loud, unruly crowds. Lots of</p>
<p>scandalous sex in the bathrooms. Ten times more adrenaline</p>
<p>than the Z.”</p>
<p>“No,” I said a little hesitantly.</p>
<p>“I’ll pick you up Sunday night. Bring fake ID.” His eyebrows</p>
<p>arched, and he graced me with an egotistical, mocking smile.</p>
<p>“No problem,” I said, trying to keep my expression ho-hum.</p>
<p>Technically, I’d be eating my words if Iwent out with Scott again,</p>
<p>but Iwasn’t going to stand here and let him call me boring. And I</p>
<p>definitely wasn’t going to let him call me a redhead. “What</p>
<p>should Iwear?”</p>
<p>“As little as legally allowable.”</p>
<p>I nearly choked. “I didn’t know you were big into bands,” I</p>
<p>said, once I’d recovered my breath.</p>
<p>“I played bass back in Portland for a band called Geezer. I’m</p>
<p>hoping to get picked up by someone local. The plan is to scout</p>
<p>talent Sunday night.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like fun,” I lied. “Count me in.” I could always back</p>
<p>out later. A quick text would take care of it. All I cared about</p>
<p>currently was not allowing Scott to call me an anal-retentive</p>
<p>wimp to my face.</p>
<p>Scott and I parted ways, and I found Vee waiting at our table,</p>
<p>half my doughnut eaten.</p>
<p>“Don’t say I didn’t warn you,” she said, watching my eyes</p>
<p>travel to my doughnut. “What did Scotty want?”</p>
<p>“He invited me to battle of the bands.”</p>
<p>“Oh boy.”</p>
<p>“For the last time, I’m not on the rebound.”</p>
<p>“For the last time, I’m not on the rebound.”</p>
<p>“Whatever you say.”</p>
<p>“Nora Grey?”</p>
<p>Vee and I looked up to find one of the bakery employees</p>
<p>standing over our table. Her work uniform consisted of a</p>
<p>lavender polo and a matching lavender name tag that read</p>
<p>MADELINE. “Excuse me, are you Nora Grey?” she asked me a</p>
<p>second time.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said, trying to figure out how she knew my name.</p>
<p>She was clutching a manila envelope to her chest, and now</p>
<p>she held it out to me. “This is for you.”</p>
<p>“What is it?” I asked, accepting the envelope.</p>
<p>She shrugged. “A guy just came in and asked me to give it to</p>
<p>you.”</p>
<p>“What guy?” Vee asked, craning her neck around the bakery.</p>
<p>“He already left. He said it was important that Nora get the</p>
<p>envelope. I thought maybe he was your boyfriend. One time a</p>
<p>guy had flowers delivered here and told us to give them to his</p>
<p>girlfriend. She was at the table in the back corner.” She pointed</p>
<p>and smiled. “I still remember.”</p>
<p>I slid my finger under the seal and glanced inside. There was</p>
<p>a sheet of paper, along with a large ring. Nothing else.</p>
<p>I looked up at Madeline, who had a dusting of flour smeared</p>
<p>across her cheek. “Are you sure this is for me?”</p>
<p>“The guy pointed right at you and said, ‘Give this to Nora</p>
<p>Grey.’ You’re Nora Grey, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>I started to reach inside the envelope, but Vee put her hand</p>
<p>on mine. “No offense,” she told Madeline, “but we’d like a little</p>
<p>privacy.”</p>
<p>“Who do you think it’s from?” I asked Vee, once Madeline</p>
<p>was out of earshot.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, but I got goose bumps when she gave it to you.</p>
<p>”</p>
<p>At Vee’s words, cold fingers walked down my spine too. “Do</p>
<p>you think it was Scott?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. What’s inside the envelope?” She slid into the</p>
<p>chair directly beside mine for a closer look.</p>
<p>I pulled the ring out, and we inspected it in silence. I could tell</p>
<p>just by looking at it that it would be loose on my thumb —definitely a man’s ring. It was made of iron, and the crown of</p>
<p>the ring, where the stone typically sat, had a raised stamp of a</p>
<p>hand. The hand was squeezed into a tight, menacing fist. The</p>
<p>crown of the ring was charred black and appeared to have</p>
<p>been lit on fire at some point.</p>
<p>“What the—,” Vee began.</p>
<p>She stopped when I pulled out the paper. Scrawled in black</p>
<p>Sharpie was a note:</p>
<p>THIS RING BELONGS TO THE BLACK HAND. HE</p>
<p>KILLED YOUR DAD.</p><p>

<p></p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>VEE WASOUTOFHERCHAIRFIRST.</p>
<p>I chased her to the bakery doors, where we rushed out to</p>
<p>blinding sunshine. Shielding our eyes, we looked both ways</p>
<p>down the boardwalk. We jogged down to the sand and did the</p>
<p>same thing. People were scattered all over the beach, but I</p>
<p>didn’t see one familiar face.</p>
<p>My heart was pounding, and I asked Vee, “Do you think it</p>
<p>was a joke?”</p>
<p>“I’m not laughing.”</p>
<p>“Was it Scott?”</p>
<p>“Maybe. He was just here, after all.”</p>
<p>“Or Marcie?” Marcie was the only other person I could think</p>
<p>of who might be thoughtless enough to carry this out.</p>
<p>Vee looked sharply at me. “As a prank? Maybe.”</p>
<p>But was Marcie that cruel? And would she even go to the</p>
<p>trouble? This was a lot more involved than a hurtful comment in</p>
<p>passing. The note, the ring—even the delivery. That took</p>
<p>planning. Marcie seemed like the kind of person who got bored</p>
<p>after five minutes of planning.</p>
<p>“Let’s get to the bottom of this,” Vee said, walking back</p>
<p>toward the bakery doors. Once inside, she singled out</p>
<p>Madeline. “We need to talk. What did the guy look like? Short?</p>
<p>Tall? Brown hair? Blond?”</p>
<p>“He was wearing a hat and sunglasses,” Madeline</p>
<p>answered, casting furtive glances at the other bakery workers,</p>
<p>who were beginning to pay Vee some attention. “Why? What</p>
<p>was in the envelope?”</p>
<p>“You’re going to have to do better than that,” Vee said. “What</p>
<p>exactly was he wearing? Was there a team logo on his hat?</p>
<p>Did he have facial hair?”</p>
<p>“I don’t remember,” Madeline stammered. “A black hat. Or</p>
<p>maybe brown. I think he was wearing jeans.”</p>
<p>“You think?”</p>
<p>“Come on,” I said, tugging Vee’s arm. “She doesn’t</p>
<p>remember.” I flicked my eyes to Madeline’s. “Thanks for your</p>
<p>help.”</p>
<p>“Help?” Vee said. “She wasn’t helpful. She can’t go</p>
<p>accepting envelopes from strange guys and not remember what</p>
<p>they look like!”</p>
<p>“She thought he was my boyfriend,” I said.</p>
<p>Madeline nodded vigorously. “I did! I’m so sorry! I thought it</p>
<p>was a present! Was something bad in the envelope? Do you</p>
<p>want me to call the police?”</p>
<p>“We want you to remember what the psychopath looked like,”</p>
<p>Vee shot back.</p>
<p>“Black jeans!” Madeline blurted suddenly. “I remember he</p>
<p>was wearing black jeans. Imean, I’m almost positive he was.”</p>
<p>“Almost positive?” Vee said.</p>
<p>I hauled her outside and down the boardwalk.After she’d had</p>
<p>enough time to cool down, she said, “Babe, I’m so sorry about</p>
<p>that. I should have looked in the envelope first. People are</p>
<p>stupid. And whoever gave you that envelope is the stupidest of</p>
<p>all. I’d happily ninja-star them, if I could.”</p>
<p>I knew she was trying to lighten the mood, but my thoughts</p>
<p>were five steps ahead. I wasn’t thinking about my dad’s death</p>
<p>anymore. We’d come to a narrow divide between shops, and I</p>
<p>pulled her off the walk, wedging us between buildings. “Listen, I</p>
<p>need to talk to you. Yesterday I thought I saw my dad. Here, at</p>
<p>the pier.”</p>
<p>Vee stared at me, but said nothing.</p>
<p>“It was him, Vee. It was him.”</p>
<p>“Babe—,” she began skeptically.</p>
<p>“I think he’s still alive.” My dad’s funeral had been closed</p>
<p>casket. Maybe there’d been a mistake, a misunderstanding,</p>
<p>and it wasn’t my dad who’d died that night. Maybe he was</p>
<p>suffering from amnesia, and that’s why he hadn’t come home.</p>
<p>Maybe something else was preventing him. Or someone …</p>
<p>“I don’t know how to say this,” Vee said, looking up, down,</p>
<p>everywhere but at me. “But he’s not coming back.”</p>
<p>“Then how do you explain what I saw?” I said defensively, hurt</p>
<p>that she of all people didn’t believe me. Tears stung my eyes,</p>
<p>and I quickly brushed them away.</p>
<p>“It was somebody else. Some other guy who looks like your</p>
<p>dad.”</p>
<p>“You weren’t there. I saw him!” I didn’t mean to snap. But I</p>
<p>wasn’t going to resign myself to the facts. Not after everything</p>
<p>I’d been through. Two months ago I’d flung myself off the gym</p>
<p>rafters at school. I knew I’d died. I couldn’t deny what I</p>
<p>remembered about that night.And yet.</p>
<p>And yet Iwas alive today.</p>
<p>There was a chance my dad was alive too. Yesterday I’d</p>
<p>seen him. I had. Maybe he was trying to communicate with me,</p>
<p>send me a message. He wanted me to know he was still alive.</p>
<p>He didn’t want me to give up on him.</p>
<p>Vee shook her head. “Don’t do this.”</p>
<p>“I’m not giving up on him. Not until I know the truth. I have to</p>
<p>find out what happened that night.”</p>
<p>“No, you don’t,” Vee said firmly. “Lay your dad’s ghost to rest.</p>
<p>Digging this up isn’t going to change the past—it’s going to</p>
<p>make you relive it.”</p>
<p>Lay my dad’s ghost to rest? What about me? How was I</p>
<p>supposed to rest until I knew the truth? Vee didn’t understand.</p>
<p>She wasn’t the one whose father had been unexplainably and</p>
<p>violently ripped away. Her family wasn’t shattered. She still had</p>
<p>everything.</p>
<p>The only thing I had left was hope.</p>
<p>I spent Sunday afternoon at Enzo’s Bistro in the company of the</p>
<p>periodic table of the elements, throwing all my concentration</p>
<p>into homework, attempting to crowd out any thought of my dad</p>
<p>or the envelope I’d received telling me the Black Hand was</p>
<p>responsible for his death. It had to be a prank. The envelope,</p>
<p>the ring, the note—it was all someone’s idea of a cruel joke.</p>
<p>Maybe Scott, maybe Marcie. But in all honesty, I didn’t think it</p>
<p>was either of them. Scott had sounded sincere when he’d</p>
<p>offered his condolences to me and my mom. And Marcie’s</p>
<p>cruelty was almost always immature and spontaneous.</p>
<p>Since I was seated at a computer and already logged in, I</p>
<p>ran an Internet search for the Black Hand. I wanted to prove to</p>
<p>myself there was no validity in the note. Probably someone had</p>
<p>found the ring at a secondhand store, come up with the clever</p>
<p>name of the Black Hand, followed me to the boardwalk, and</p>
<p>asked Madeline to hand the envelope to me. Looking back, it</p>
<p>didn’t even matter that Madeline couldn’t remember what the</p>
<p>guy looked like, because mostly likely, he wasn’t the person</p>
<p>behind the prank. That person had probably stopped a random</p>
<p>guy on the boardwalk and paid him a few dollars to deliver the</p>
<p>envelope. That’s what I would have done. If I were a sick,</p>
<p>twisted person who got off on hurting other people.</p>
<p>A page of links for the Black Hand popped up on the monitor.</p>
<p>The first link was for a secret society that had reportedly</p>
<p>assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in 1914,</p>
<p>catapulting the world into World War I. The next link was for a</p>
<p>rock band. The Black Hand was also the name of a group of</p>
<p>vampires in a role-playing game. Finally, in the early 1900s, an</p>
<p>Italian gang dubbed the Black Hand took New York by storm.</p>
<p>Not one link mentioned Maine. Not one image showed an iron</p>
<p>ring stamped with a fist.</p>
<p>See? I told myself. Aprank.</p>
<p>Realizing I’d strayed to the very topic Iwasn’t supposed to be</p>
<p>thinking about, I pinned my eyes back on the homework spread</p>
<p>out before me. I needed to get a grip on chemical formulas and</p>
<p>calculating atomic mass. My first chemistry lab was coming up,</p>
<p>and with Marcie as my partner, I was preparing for the worst by</p>
<p>putting in extra hours outside of school to drag along her dead</p>
<p>weight. I punched a few numbers into my calculator, then</p>
<p>carefully transcribed my answer onto the open page of my</p>
<p>notebook, repeating the answer loudly in my head, to block out</p>
<p>thoughts of the Black Hand.</p>
<p>At five, I called my mom, who was in New Hampshire.</p>
<p>“Checking in,” I said. “How’s work going?”</p>
<p>“Same old. You?”</p>
<p>“I’m at Enzo’s trying to study, but the mango smoothie keeps</p>
<p>calling to me.”</p>
<p>“Now you’re making me hungry.”</p>
<p>“Hungry enough to come home?”</p>
<p>She gave one of those “it’s out of my control” sighs. “I wish I</p>
<p>could. We’ll make waffles and smoothies for brunch on</p>
<p>Saturday.”</p>
<p>At six, Vee called and talked me into meeting her for</p>
<p>spinning at the gym. At seven thirty, she dropped me off at the</p>
<p>farmhouse. I had just finished showering and was standing in</p>
<p>front of the fridge, hunting down the leftover stir-fry my mom had</p>
<p>stored there yesterday before leaving, when there was a loud</p>
<p>knock at the front door.</p>
<p>I squinted into the peephole. On the other side of the door,</p>
<p>Scott Parnell made the peace sign.</p>
<p>Scott Parnell made the peace sign.</p>
<p>“Battle of the bands!” I said aloud, smacking my palm to my</p>
<p>forehead. I’d completely forgotten to cancel. I looked down at</p>
<p>my pj pants and groaned.</p>
<p>After a failed attempt at fluffing my wet hair, I turned the bolt</p>
<p>and opened the door.</p>
<p>Scott checked out my jammies. “You forgot.”</p>
<p>“Are you kidding? I’ve been looking forward to this all day, I’m</p>
<p>just running a little late.” I pointed over my shoulder at the</p>
<p>staircase. “I’ll get dressed. Why don’t you … reheat some stirfry?</p>
<p>It’s in a blue Tupperware in the fridge.”</p>
<p>I took the stairs up two at a time, shut my bedroom door, and</p>
<p>called Vee.</p>
<p>“I need you to come over now,” I said. “I’m on my way to</p>
<p>battle of the bands with Scott.”</p>
<p>“Is the point of this call to make me jealous?”</p>
<p>I put my ear to the door. It sounded like Scott was opening</p>
<p>and closing cabinets in the kitchen. For all I knew, he was</p>
<p>hunting for prescription drugs or beer. He was going to be</p>
<p>disappointed on both counts, unless he had unrealistic hopes of</p>
<p>getting high on my iron pills. “I’m not trying to make you jealous. I</p>
<p>don’t want to go alone.”</p>
<p>“So tell him you can’t go.”</p>
<p>“The thing is … I kind of want to go.” I had no idea where this</p>
<p>sudden desire had come from. All I knew was that I didn’t want</p>
<p>to spend the night alone. I’d put in a full day of homework,</p>
<p>followed by spinning, and the last thing I wanted was to stay</p>
<p>home tonight and check off my list of weekend chores. I’d been</p>
<p>good all day. Make that good my whole life. I deserved to have</p>
<p>some fun. Scott wasn’t the best date in the world, but he wasn’t</p>
<p>dead last, either. “Are you coming or not?”</p>
<p>“I have to admit, it sounds a lot better than conjugating</p>
<p>Spanish verbs in my room all night. I’ll call Rixon and see if he</p>
<p>wants to come too.”</p>
<p>I hung up and did a quick inventory of my closet. I decided on</p>
<p>a pale silk cami, a miniskirt, opaque tights, and ballet flats. I</p>
<p>sprayed perfume in the air and walked through it for a light,</p>
<p>grapefruity scent. In the back of my mind, I wondered why I was</p>
<p>spending the time to clean up for Scott. He was going nowhere</p>
<p>in life, we had nothing in common, and most of our brief</p>
<p>conversations including flipping insults at each other. Not only</p>
<p>that, but Patch had told me to stay away from him. And that’s</p>
<p>when it hit me. Chances were, I was drawn to Scott because of</p>
<p>some deep-rooted psychological reason involving defiance and</p>
<p>revenge.And it all pointed back to Patch.</p>
<p>As I saw it, I could do one of two things: sit home and let</p>
<p>Patch dictate my life, or ditch my Sunday-school-good-girl self</p>
<p>and have a little fun. And even though Iwasn’t ready to admit it, I</p>
<p>hoped Patch found out I’d gone to battle of the bands with Scott.</p>
<p>I hoped the thought of me with another guy drove him crazy.</p>
<p>Mind made up, I flipped my head over, dried my hair just</p>
<p>enough to give my curls definition, and breezed into the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Ready,” I told Scott.</p>
<p>He gave me the second full-body scan of the night, but this</p>
<p>time I felt a lot more self-conscious. “Looks good, Grey,” he</p>
<p>said.</p>
<p>“Right back at you.” I smiled, going for chummy, but I felt</p>
<p>nervous. Which was ridiculous, since this was Scott we were</p>
<p>talking about. We were friends. Not even friends.</p>
<p>Acquaintances.</p>
<p>“Cover charge is ten bucks.”</p>
<p>I stood there a moment. “Oh. Right. I knew that. Can we stop</p>
<p>by an ATM on the way?” I had fifty dollars’ worth of birthday</p>
<p>money sitting in my checking account. I’d already allocated the</p>
<p>money to go toward the Cabriolet, but it wasn’t like withdrawing</p>
<p>ten was going to kill the deal. At the rate I was saving, I wouldn’t</p>
<p>be able to buy the Cabriolet before my twenty-fifth birthday</p>
<p>anyway.</p>
<p>Scott tossed a Maine driver’s license on the counter, with my</p>
<p>yearbook photo copied onto it. “Ready, Marlene?”</p>
<p>Marlene?</p>
<p>“Iwasn’t joking about the fake ID. Not thinking of backing out,</p>
<p>are you?” He grinned like he knew exactly how many points my</p>
<p>blood pressure had shot up at the thought of using illegal ID,</p>
<p>and he’d bet all his money that I’d back out in five seconds.</p>
<p>Four, three, two …</p>
<p>I swiped the ID off the counter. “Ready.”</p>
<p>Scott drove the Mustang through the center of Coldwater to the</p>
<p>opposite side of town, down a few winding back roads and</p>
<p>across the railroad tracks. He pulled up in front of a four-story</p>
<p>brick warehouse overrun with weeds that twined up the exterior.</p>
<p>A long line of people waited outside the doors. From what I</p>
<p>could tell, the windows had been covered from the inside with</p>
<p>black paper, but through the cracks between tape jobs, I saw</p>
<p>the slice of a strobe light. A neon blue sign above the door</p>
<p>glowed with the words THEDEVIL’SHANDBAG.</p>
<p>I’d been to this section of town once before, in the fourth</p>
<p>grade, when my parents drove me and Vee to a haunted house</p>
<p>staged for Halloween. I’d never been to the Devil’s Handbag,</p>
<p>but I was certain just by looking at it that my mom would have</p>
<p>rather I kept it that way. Scott’s description of the place bounced</p>
<p>up from my memory. Loud, unrehearsed music. Loud, unruly</p>
<p>crowds. Lots of scandalous sex in the bathrooms.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>“I’ll let you out here,” Scott said, steering to the curb. “Find us</p>
<p>good seats. Close to the stage, in the center.”</p>
<p>I climbed out and walked to the back of the line. In all honesty,</p>
<p>I’d never been to a club that required a cover charge before. I’d</p>
<p>never been to a club, period. My nightlife consisted of movies</p>
<p>and Baskin-Robbins with Vee.</p>
<p>My cell sang out Vee’s ringtone.</p>
<p>“I hear warm-up music, but all I see are train tracks and some</p>
<p>abandoned boxcars.”</p>
<p>“You’re a couple blocks away. Are you in the Neon, or on</p>
<p>foot?”</p>
<p>“In the Neon.”</p>
<p>“I’ll come find you.”</p>
<p>I pulled out of the line, which was growing by the minute. At</p>
<p>the end of the block, I rounded the corner, heading toward the</p>
<p>the end of the block, I rounded the corner, heading toward the</p>
<p>tracks Scott had driven the Mustang across to get here. The</p>
<p>sidewalk was cracked and uneven from years of disrepair, and</p>
<p>with the streetlights placed few and far between, I had to watch</p>
<p>my step to keep from snagging my toe and tripping. The</p>
<p>warehouses down the block were dark, their windows vacant</p>
<p>eyes. The warehouses gave way to abandoned brick</p>
<p>townhouses splashed with graffiti. Over a hundred years ago,</p>
<p>this had probably been the hub of Cold-water. Not so anymore.</p>
<p>The moon cast an eerie, translucent light on the graveyard of</p>
<p>buildings.</p>
<p>I folded my arms close to my body and walked faster. Two</p>
<p>blocks away, a form materialized out of the smoggy darkness.</p>
<p>“Vee?” I called ahead.</p>
<p>The figure continued toward me, head down, hands</p>
<p>pocketed. Not Vee, but a man, tall and slender, with broad</p>
<p>shoulders and a vaguely familiar gait. I didn’t feel especially</p>
<p>comfortable passing by a man alone on this stretch of sidewalk</p>
<p>and reached for my cell in my pocket. I was just about to call</p>
<p>Vee and get her exact location, when the man passed under a</p>
<p>cone of streetlight. He was wearing my dad’s leather bomber</p>
<p>jacket.</p>
<p>I stopped short.</p>
<p>Completely unaware of me, he climbed a set of steps to his</p>
<p>right and disappeared inside one of the abandoned</p>
<p>townhouses.</p>
<p>The hairs on my neck rose. “Dad?”</p>
<p>I broke into an automatic jog. I crossed the street without</p>
<p>bothering to look for traffic, knowing there was none. When I</p>
<p>made it to the townhouse I was sure he’d entered, I tried the tall</p>
<p>double doors. Locked. I shook the handles, rattling the doors,</p>
<p>but they didn’t give. Cupping my hands around my eyes, I</p>
<p>peered through one of the windows flanking the door. The lights</p>
<p>were off, but I could make out lumps of furniture covered in pale</p>
<p>sheets. My heart was beating all over the place. Was my dad</p>
<p>alive?All this time—had he been living here?</p>
<p>“Dad!” I called through the glass. “It’s me—Nora!”</p>
<p>At the top of the staircase inside the townhouse, his shoes</p>
<p>vanished down the hall. “Dad!” I yelled, pounding the glass. “I’m</p>
<p>out here!”</p>
<p>I backed away, head tilted up, looking at the second-story</p>
<p>windows, watching for his shadow to pass by.</p>
<p>The back entrance.</p>
<p>The thought floated to the surface of my mind, and I</p>
<p>immediately acted on it. I jogged down the steps, slipping into</p>
<p>the narrow passageway cutting between this townhouse and the</p>
<p>next. Of course. The back door. If it was unlocked, I could get</p>
<p>inside to my dad—</p>
<p>Ice kissed the back of my neck. The chill tiptoed down my</p>
<p>spine, momentarily paralyzing me. I stood at the end of the</p>
<p>passageway, eyes fastened on the backyard. Bushes swayed</p>
<p>docilely in the breeze. The open gate creaked on its hinges.</p>
<p>Very slowly I backed away, not about to trust the stillness. Not</p>
<p>about to believe I wasn’t alone. I’d felt this way before, and it</p>
<p>had always signaled danger.</p>
<p>Nora, we’re not alone. Someone else is here. Go back!</p>
<p>“Dad?” Iwhispered, my mind darting.</p>
<p>Go find Vee. You need to leave! I’ll find you again. Hurry!</p>
<p>I didn’t care what he said—I wasn’t leaving. Not until I knew</p>
<p>what was going on. Not until I saw him. How could he expect me</p>
<p>to leave? He was here. A flutter of relief and nervous excitement</p>
<p>bubbled up inside me, eclipsing any fear I felt.</p>
<p>“Dad? Where are you?”</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>“Dad?” I tried again. “I’m not leaving.”</p>
<p>This time there was an answer.</p>
<p>The back door is unlocked.</p>
<p>I touched my head, feeling his words echo there. Something</p>
<p>was different about his voice this time, but not noticeably</p>
<p>enough to place a finger on it. Slightly colder, maybe? Sharper?</p>
<p>“Dad?” Iwhispered at the faintest volume.</p>
<p>I’m inside.</p>
<p>His voice was louder now, a real sound. Not just in my head</p>
<p>this time, but in my ears, too. I turned toward the house, certain</p>
<p>he’d spoken through the window. Stepping off the flagstone</p>
<p>path, I tentatively laid my palm on the windowpane. I desperately</p>
<p>wanted it to be him, but at the same time, the goose bumps</p>
<p>popping up all over my skin warned me it could be a trick. A</p>
<p>trap.</p>
<p>“Dad?” My voice wavered. “I’m scared.”</p>
<p>On the other side of the glass, a hand mirrored mine, five</p>
<p>fingertips aligning with my own. My dad’s gold wedding band</p>
<p>was on the ring finger of his left hand. My blood pumped so</p>
<p>hard I felt dizzy. It was him. My dad was inches away.Alive.</p>
<p>Come inside. I won’t hurt you. Come, Nora.</p>
<p>The urgency in his words frightened me. I clawed at the</p>
<p>window, trying to locate the latch, desperately needing to throw</p>
<p>my arms around him and stop him from leaving again. Tears</p>
<p>streamed down my cheeks. I thought about running around to</p>
<p>the back door, but I couldn’t bring myself to leave him, even for a</p>
<p>few seconds. I couldn’t lose him again.</p>
<p>I splayed my hand on the window, harder this time. “I’m right</p>
<p>here, Dad!”</p>
<p>This time, the glass frosted at my touch. Tiny fibers of ice</p>
<p>branched across the glass with a brittle, crackling noise. I</p>
<p>jerked away at the sudden cold that shot up my arm, but my skin</p>
<p>was stuck to the glass. Frozen. Crying out, I tried to free myself</p>
<p>using my other hand. My dad’s hand melted through the</p>
<p>windowpane and closed around mine, holding me so I couldn’t</p>
<p>run. He jerked me roughly forward, the bricks snagging my</p>
<p>clothes, my arm impossibly vanishing into the window. My</p>
<p>terrified reflection stared back, my mouth open in a startled</p>
<p>scream. The only thought pounding through my head was that</p>
<p>this couldn’t be my dad.</p>
<p>“Help!” I yelled. “Vee! Can you hear me? Help!”</p>
<p>Thrashing my body side to side, I tried to use my weight to</p>
<p>break free. A piercing pain sliced into the forearm he held</p>
<p>captive, and an image of a knife burst into my mind with such</p>
<p>intensity that I thought my head had split in two. Fire licked my</p>
<p>forearm— he was cutting me open.</p>
<p>“Stop!” I shrieked. “You’re hurting me!”</p>
<p>I felt his presence flex across my mind, his own sight</p>
<p>eclipsing mine. There was blood everywhere. Black and</p>
<p>slippery … and mine. Bile rose in my throat.</p>
<p>“Patch!” I screamed into the night with nothing short of terror</p>
<p>and absolute desperation.</p>
<p>The hand dissolved from around mine, and I dropped</p>
<p>backward to the ground. Instinctively I clutched my wounded arm</p>
<p>against my shirt to stop the bleeding, but to my amazement,</p>
<p>there was no blood. No cut.</p>
<p>Gulping air, I stared up at the window. Perfectly intact, it</p>
<p>reflected the tree behind me, which swung back and forth in the</p>
<p>night air. I scurried to my feet and stumbled out to the sidewalk. I</p>
<p>ran in the direction of the Devil’s Handbag, turning to glance</p>
<p>over my shoulder every few steps. I expected to see my dad —or his doppelgänger—appear from one of the townhouses,</p>
<p>holding a knife, but the sidewalk stayed empty.</p>
<p>I faced forward to cross the street and saw the person a half</p>
<p>blink before I slammed into her.</p>
<p>“There you are,” Vee said, reaching out to steady me as I</p>
<p>choked back a scream. “I think we missed each other. I made it</p>
<p>to the Devil’s Handbag and backtracked to find you. Are you</p>
<p>okay? You look ready to throw up.”</p>
<p>I didn’t want to stand on the street corner any longer.</p>
<p>Reflecting on what had just happened at the townhouse, I</p>
<p>couldn’t help but be reminded of the time I’d hit Chauncey with</p>
<p>the Neon. Moments later, the car had returned to normal,</p>
<p>leaving no evidence of an accident. But this time it was</p>
<p>personal. This time it was my dad. My eyes burned, and my jaw</p>
<p>quivered as I spoke. “I—I thought I saw my dad again.”</p>
<p>Vee folded her arms around me. “Babe.”</p>
<p>“I know. It wasn’t real. It wasn’t real,” I repeated, trying to</p>
<p>reassure myself. I blinked several times in succession, tears</p>
<p>staining my vision. But it had felt real. So very real …</p>
<p>“Do you want to talk about it?” What was there to talk about? I was being haunted.</p>
<p>Someone was messing with my mind. Toying with me. A fallen</p>
<p>angel? A Nephil? My dad’s ghost? Or was it my own mind</p>
<p>betraying me? It wasn’t like this was the first time I’d imagined</p>
<p>seeing my dad. I’d thought he was trying to communicate with</p>
<p>me, but maybe this was a self-defense mechanism. Maybe my</p>
<p>mind was making me see things I refused to accept were gone</p>
<p>forever. It was filling the void, because that was easier than</p>
<p>letting go. Whatever had happened back there, it wasn’t real. It wasn’t</p>
<p>my dad. He would never hurt me. He loved me.</p>
<p>“Let’s go back to the Devil’s Handbag,” I said, exhaling</p>
<p>shakily. I wanted to distance myself from the townhouse as</p>
<p>quickly as possible. Once more I told myself that whoever I’d</p>
<p>seen back there, he wasn’t my dad.</p>
<p>The echoing clash, clang, and whine of drums and guitars</p>
<p>warming up for the show grew louder, and while my panic was</p>
<p>slow to subside, I felt my heartbeat slowing down. There was</p>
<p>something reassuring about the idea of losing myself inside the</p>
<p>swarm of hundreds of bodies packed inside the warehouse.</p>
<p>Despite what had happened, I didn’t want to go home, and I</p>
<p>didn’t want to be alone; I wanted to slip into the center of the</p>
<p>crowd. There was strength in numbers.</p>
<p>Vee grabbed my wrist and brought me to a halt. “Is that who I</p>
<p>think it is?”</p>
<p>Half a block up, Marcie Millar was climbing into a car. Her</p>
<p>body looked poured into a little black scrap of fabric that was</p>
<p>short enough to show off her black lace thigh-highs and garter</p>
<p>belt. Tall, over-the-knee black boots and a black fedora</p>
<p>completed the outfit. But it wasn’t her outfit that had caught my</p>
<p>attention. It was the car. A shiny black Jeep Commander. The</p>
<p>engine caught, and the Jeep pulled around the corner and out of</p>
<p>sight.</p><p>

<p></p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>“HOLY FREAK SHOW,” VEE WHISPERED. “DID I JUST SEE that? Did I</p>
<p>really just see Marcie climb into Patch’s Jeep?” I opened my</p>
<p>mouth to say something, but it felt like someone had stuffed</p>
<p>nails down my throat.</p>
<p>“Was it just me,” Vee said, “or could you see her red thong</p>
<p>peeking out from under her dress?”</p>
<p>“That wasn’t a dress,” I said, leaning back against a building</p>
<p>for support.</p>
<p>“I was trying to be optimistic, but you’re right. That wasn’t a</p>
<p>dress. That was a tube top stretched down around her bony</p>
<p>booty. The only thing keeping it from springing up around her</p>
<p>waist is gravity.”</p>
<p>“I think I’m going to be sick,” I said, the nails-in-the-throat</p>
<p>sensation spreading to my stomach.</p>
<p>Vee pushed down on my shoulders, forcing me to sit on a</p>
<p>square of sidewalk. “Deep breaths.”</p>
<p>“He’s going out with Marcie.” It was almost too horrific to</p>
<p>believe.</p>
<p>“Marcie puts out,” said Vee. “That’s the only reason. She’s a</p>
<p>pig.A rat.”</p>
<p>“He told me there was nothing going on between them.”</p>
<p>“Patch is a lot of things, but honest isn’t one of them.”</p>
<p>I blinked down the street where the Jeep had vanished. I felt</p>
<p>the unexplainable urge to storm after them and do something I</p>
<p>hoped I’d regret—like choke Marcie with her stupid red thong.</p>
<p>“This is not your fault,” Vee said. “He’s the jerk who took</p>
<p>advantage of you.”</p>
<p>“I need to go home,” I said, my voice numb.</p>
<p>Just then a police cruiser came to a stop near the club’s</p>
<p>entrance. A tall, lean cop in black slacks and a dress shirt</p>
<p>angled out. The street was heavily shadowed, but I recognized</p>
<p>him immediately. Detective Basso. I’d fallen under the</p>
<p>jurisdiction of his job once before, and I had no desire for a</p>
<p>repeat performance. Especially since I was fairly certain I</p>
<p>wasn’t on his list of favorite people.</p>
<p>Detective Basso shouldered his way to the front of the line,</p>
<p>flashed his badge at the bouncer, and walked inside without</p>
<p>slowing.</p>
<p>“Whoa,” Vee said. “Was that a cop?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and he’s too old, so don’t even think about it. I want to</p>
<p>go home. Where did you park?”</p>
<p>“He doesn’t look much over thirty. Since when is thirty too</p>
<p>old?”</p>
<p>“His name is Detective Basso. He questioned me after the</p>
<p>incident with Jules at school.” I loved how I kept referring to it as</p>
<p>the incident, instead of what it really was.Attempted murder.</p>
<p>“Basso. I like that. Short and sexy, just like my name. Did he</p>
<p>frisk you?”</p>
<p>I gave her a sideways look, but she was still gazing at the</p>
<p>I gave her a sideways look, but she was still gazing at the</p>
<p>door he’d gone through. “No. He questioned me.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t mind being handcuffed by him. Just don’t tell</p>
<p>Rixon.”</p>
<p>“Let’s go. If the police are here, something bad is going to</p>
<p>happen.”</p>
<p>“Bad is my middle name,” she said, linking her arm through</p>
<p>mine and drawing me toward the warehouse entrance.</p>
<p>“Vee—”</p>
<p>“There are probably two hundred people inside. It’s dark.</p>
<p>He’s not going to pick you out of the crowd, if he even</p>
<p>remembers you at all. Probably he’s forgotten you. Besides,</p>
<p>he’s not going to arrest you—you’re not doing anything illegal. Well, aside from the whole fake ID business, but everybody</p>
<p>does that. And if he really wanted to bust the whole place, he’d</p>
<p>have brought backup. One cop isn’t going to take down this</p>
<p>crowd.”</p>
<p>“How do you know I have fake ID?”</p>
<p>She gave me an “I’m not as dumb as I look” glance. “You’re</p>
<p>here, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“How are you planning to get in?”</p>
<p>“Same as you.”</p>
<p>“You have fake ID?” I couldn’t believe it. “Since when?”</p>
<p>Vee winked. “Rixon is good for more than just kissing. Come</p>
<p>on, let’s go. Being the good friend you are, you wouldn’t even</p>
<p>think about asking me to break out of my house and violate the</p>
<p>terms of my grounding for nothing. Especially since I already</p>
<p>called Rixon, and he’s on his way.”</p>
<p>I groaned. But this wasn’t Vee’s fault. I was the one who’d</p>
<p>thought coming here tonight was a good idea. “Five minutes,</p>
<p>but that’s it.”</p>
<p>The line was moving fast, pouring into the building, and</p>
<p>against my better judgment, I paid the cover charge and</p>
<p>followed Vee into the dark, sticky, deafening warehouse. In a</p>
<p>way, it felt strangely good to be surrounded by darkness and</p>
<p>noise; the music was too loud to think, which meant even if I’d</p>
<p>wanted to, I couldn’t concentrate on Patch, and what he was</p>
<p>doing with Marcie at this precise moment.</p>
<p>There was a bar at the back, painted black, with metal bar</p>
<p>stools and pendant lights that hung from the ceiling, and Vee</p>
<p>and I slid onto the last two available stools.</p>
<p>“ID?” the guy behind the bar asked.</p>
<p>Vee shook her head. “Just a Diet Coke, please.”</p>
<p>“I’ll take a cherry Coke,” I added.</p>
<p>Vee poked my ribs and leaned sideways. “Did you see that?</p>
<p>He asked to see our ID. How awesome is that? I bet he wanted</p>
<p>our names but was too shy to ask.”</p>
<p>The bartender filled two glasses and slid them down the</p>
<p>counter, where they stopped directly in front of us.</p>
<p>“That’s a cool trick,” Vee shouted at him over the music.</p>
<p>He gave her the finger and moved down the bar to the next</p>
<p>customer.</p>
<p>“He was too short for me anyway,” she said.</p>
<p>“Have you seen Scott?” I asked, sitting tall on my stool to try</p>
<p>to see over the crowd. He should have had plenty of time to</p>
<p>park by now, but I didn’t see him. Maybe he hadn’t wanted to</p>
<p>park by now, but I didn’t see him. Maybe he hadn’t wanted to</p>
<p>use metered parking and had driven farther out to find free</p>
<p>parking. Still. Unless he’d parked two miles away, and that</p>
<p>seemed highly unlikely, he should have been here.</p>
<p>“Uh-oh. Guess who just walked in?” Vee’s eyes were fixed</p>
<p>over my shoulder, and her expression darkened to a scowl.</p>
<p>“Marcie Millar, that’s who.”</p>
<p>“I thought she left!” A jolt of anger fired through me. “Is Patch</p>
<p>with her?”</p>
<p>“Negative.”</p>
<p>I squared my shoulders and sat even higher. “I’m calm. I can</p>
<p>handle it. Most likely, she won’t see us. Even if she does, she’s</p>
<p>not going to come over to talk.” And even though not one part of</p>
<p>me believed it, I added, “There’s probably some twisted</p>
<p>explanation for why she got into his Jeep.”</p>
<p>“Just like there’s a twisted explanation for why she’s wearing</p>
<p>his hat?”</p>
<p>I flattened my hands on the bar and swung around. Sure</p>
<p>enough, Marcie was elbowing her way into the crowd, her</p>
<p>strawberry-blond ponytail streaming out the back of Patch’s ball</p>
<p>cap. If that wasn’t evidence they were together, I didn’t know</p>
<p>what was.</p>
<p>“I’m going to kill her,” I said to Vee, turning back to face the</p>
<p>bar, gripping my cherry Coke, heat rising in my cheeks.</p>
<p>“Of course you are. And here’s your chance. She’s beelining</p>
<p>this way.”</p>
<p>A moment later, Marcie ordered the guy beside me out of his</p>
<p>seat and perched herself on top of it. She took off Patch’s cap</p>
<p>and shook out her hair, then pressed the cap to her face,</p>
<p>inhaling deeply. “Doesn’t he smell amazing?”</p>
<p>“Hey, Nora,” Vee said, “didn’t Patch have lice last week?”</p>
<p>“What is it?” Marcie asked rhetorically. “Fresh-cut grass? An</p>
<p>exotic spice? Or maybe … mint?”</p>
<p>I set my glass down a little too hard, and some of the cherry</p>
<p>Coke sloshed onto the bar.</p>
<p>“That’s really eco-friendly of you,” Vee told Marcie. “Recycling</p>
<p>Nora’s old trash.”</p>
<p>“Hot trash is better than fat trash,” Marcie said.</p>
<p>“Fat this,” Vee said, and she picked up my cherry Coke and</p>
<p>underhanded it at Marcie. But someone in the crowd bumped</p>
<p>Vee from behind, so instead of sailing straight at Marcie, the</p>
<p>Coke spread out and splattered all three of us.</p>
<p>“Look what you did!” Marcie said, jumping off her bar stool</p>
<p>so hard she knocked it over. She swiped at the Coke in her lap.</p>
<p>“This dress is Bebe! Do you know how much it cost? Two</p>
<p>hundred dollars.”</p>
<p>“It’s not worth that much anymore,” Vee said. “And I don’t</p>
<p>know what you’re complaining about. I bet you shoplifted it.”</p>
<p>“Yeah? So? What’s your point?”</p>
<p>“With you, what you see is what you get. And I see cheap.</p>
<p>Nothing says cheap like shoplifting.”</p>
<p>“Nothing says fat like a double chin.”</p>
<p>Vee’s eyes went slitty. “You’re dead. You hear me? Dead.”</p>
<p>Marcie shifted her eyes in my direction. “By the way, Nora, I</p>
<p>thought you’d like to know. Patch told me he broke up with you</p>
<p>because you weren’t enough of a slut.”</p>
<p>Vee smacked Marcie upside the head with her handbag.</p>
<p>“What was that for?” Marcie shrieked, clutching her head.</p>
<p>Vee smacked her other ear. Marcie staggered backward,</p>
<p>eyes dazed but quickly narrowing. “You little—,” she began.</p>
<p>“Stop!” I shouted, wedging myself between them and holding</p>
<p>my arms out. We’d drawn the attention of the crowd, and people</p>
<p>were shuffling closer, their interest piqued by the prospect of a</p>
<p>cat fight. I didn’t care what happened to Marcie, but Vee was a</p>
<p>different matter. Chances were, if she got in a fight, Detective</p>
<p>Basso would haul her down to the station. Combined with</p>
<p>sneaking out of the house, I didn’t think jail time would go over</p>
<p>well with her parents. “Let’s all just back away. Vee, go get the</p>
<p>Neon. I’ll meet you outside.”</p>
<p>“She called me fat. She deserves to die. You said so</p>
<p>yourself.” Vee’s breathing was ragged.</p>
<p>“How do you plan on killing me?” Marcie sneered. “By sitting</p>
<p>on me?”</p>
<p>And that was when everything broke loose. Vee snatched her</p>
<p>own Coke off the bar and raised her arm, aiming to throw.</p>
<p>Marcie turned to run, but in her hurry, tripped backward over her</p>
<p>fallen bar stool and toppled to the floor. I swiveled to Vee,</p>
<p>hoping to defuse any further violence, when my knee was</p>
<p>kicked out from behind. I went down, and the next thing I knew,</p>
<p>Marcie was on top, straddling me.</p>
<p>“This is for stealing Tod Bérot from me in fifth grade,” she</p>
<p>said, punching me in the eye.</p>
<p>I yowled and grabbed my eye. “Tod Bérot?” I shouted. “What</p>
<p>are you talking about? That was the fifth grade!”</p>
<p>“And this is for sticking that picture of me with a giant zit on</p>
<p>my chin on the front page of the eZine last year!”</p>
<p>“That wasn’t me!”</p>
<p>Okay, maybe I’d had a little say in the photo selection, but it</p>
<p>wasn’t like I was the only one. And anyway, Marcie was holding</p>
<p>that over my head? Wasn’t a year a little long to be clinging to a</p>
<p>grudge?</p>
<p>Marcie shouted, “And this is for your whore of a—”</p>
<p>“You’re crazy!” This time I blocked the hit and managed to</p>
<p>grab the leg of the nearest bar stool and overturn it on her.</p>
<p>Marcie shoved the bar stool away. Before I could get my feet</p>
<p>under me, she swiped a drink from a passerby and doused me</p>
<p>with it.</p>
<p>“An eye for an eye,” she said. “You humiliate me, I humiliate</p>
<p>you.”</p>
<p>I wiped Coke out of my eyes. My right eye flowered with pain</p>
<p>where Marcie had punched me. I felt the bruise spreading under</p>
<p>my skin, tattooing me blue and purple. My hair was dripping</p>
<p>Coke, my best camisole was torn, and I felt demoralized,</p>
<p>beaten … and rejected. Patch had moved on to Marcie Millar.</p>
<p>And Marcie had just punctuated the fact.</p>
<p>My feelings were no excuse for what I did next, but they were</p>
<p>definitely a catalyst. I had no clue how to fight, but I closed my</p>
<p>hands into fists and clipped Marcie in the jaw. For a moment</p>
<p>her expression was frozen in surprise. She scooted off me, two-</p>
<p>handing her jaw, gaping at me. Buoyed by my small victory, I</p>
<p>lunged for her, but came up short because someone had me</p>
<p>under the armpits, hauling me upright.</p>
<p>“Get out of here now,” Patch said in my ear, dragging me</p>
<p>toward the doors.</p>
<p>“I’m going to kill her!” I said, fighting to get around him.</p>
<p>A gathering crowd enveloped us, chanting, “Fight! fight!</p>
<p>fight!” Patch brushed them out of the way and dragged me</p>
<p>through. Behind Patch, Marcie got to her feet and flipped me</p>
<p>her middle finger. Her grin was smug, her eyebrows high. The</p>
<p>message was clear: Bring it on.</p>
<p>Patch handed me off to Vee, then went back and clamped a</p>
<p>hand around Marcie’s upper arm. Before I could see where he</p>
<p>took her, Vee wrestled me toward the nearest exit. We came</p>
<p>out in the alley.</p>
<p>“Fun as seeing you fight Marcie was, I figured it probably</p>
<p>wasn’t worth the cost of you spending the night in jail,” Vee said.</p>
<p>“I hate her!” My voice still sounded hysterical.</p>
<p>“Detective Basso was plowing through the crowd when</p>
<p>Patch lifted you off her. I figured that was my cue to step in.”</p>
<p>“Where did he take Marcie? I saw Patch grab her.”</p>
<p>“Does it matter? Hopefully they both get hauled downtown.”</p>
<p>Our shoes crunched through the gravel as we ran down the</p>
<p>alley toward where Vee had parked. The blue and red lights of a</p>
<p>patrol car sliced past the opening of the alley, and Vee and I</p>
<p>pressed back against the warehouse.</p>
<p>“Well, that was exciting,” Vee said, once we were locked</p>
<p>inside the Neon.</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah, sure,” I said through my teeth.</p>
<p>Vee licked my arm. “You taste pretty good. You’re making me</p>
<p>thirsty, smelling like cherry Coke and all.”</p>
<p>“This is all your fault!” I said. “You’re the one who threw my</p>
<p>Coke at Marcie! If it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t have gotten in a</p>
<p>fight.”</p>
<p>“Fight? You laid there and took it. You should have had Patch</p>
<p>teach you some moves before you broke up with him.”</p>
<p>My cell phone was ringing, and I yanked it out of my purse.</p>
<p>“What?” I snapped. When no one answered, I realized I was so</p>
<p>worked up that I’d confused the text message chirp with an</p>
<p>actual call.</p>
<p>One unread message was waiting for me from an unknown</p>
<p>number. STAYHOMETONIGHT.</p>
<p>“That’s scary,” Vee said, bending sideways to read. “Who</p>
<p>have you been giving your number to?”</p>
<p>“It’s probably a mistype. It’s probably meant for someone</p>
<p>else.” Of course, I was thinking about the townhouse, my dad,</p>
<p>and the vision I’d had of him cutting open my arm.</p>
<p>I tossed the cell into my open purse at my feet and bowed my</p>
<p>head into my hands. My eye throbbed. I was scared, alone,</p>
<p>confused, and on the verge of crying uncontrollably.</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s from Patch,” Vee said.</p>
<p>“His number has never shown up as unknown before. It’s a</p>
<p>prank.” If only I could force myself to believe it. “Can we go? I</p>
<p>need Tylenol.”</p>
<p>“I think we should call Detective Basso. Police love this kind</p>
<p>“I think we should call Detective Basso. Police love this kind</p>
<p>of scary stalker crap.”</p>
<p>“You just want to call him so you can flirt with him.”</p>
<p>Vee put the Neon in gear. “Just trying to be helpful.”</p>
<p>“Maybe you should have tried being helpful ten minutes ago</p>
<p>when you threw my drink on Marcie.”</p>
<p>“At least I had the guts to.”</p>
<p>I turned in my seat, giving her the full weight of my stare. “Are</p>
<p>you accusing me of not standing up to Marcie?”</p>
<p>“She stole your boyfriend, didn’t she? Granted, he scares the</p>
<p>candy out of me, but if Marcie stole my boyfriend, there’d be hell</p>
<p>to pay.”</p>
<p>I pointed a stiff finger at the street. “Drive!”</p>
<p>“You know what? You really need a new boyfriend. You need</p>
<p>a good old-fashioned make-out session to mellow you out.” Why did everyone think I needed a new boyfriend? I didn’t</p>
<p>need a new boyfriend. I’d had enough of boyfriends to last a</p>
<p>lifetime. The only thing a boyfriend was good for was a</p>
<p>shattered heart.</p><p>

<p></p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>AN HOUR LATER, I’D FIXEDAND EATENALATE SNACK of cream cheese</p>
<p>frosting spread on graham crackers, tidied up the kitchen, and</p>
<p>watched a little TV. In a shadowy corner of my mind, I hadn’t</p>
<p>managed to forget the text message warning me to stay home.</p>
<p>It had been easier to brush off as a miscall or prank when I was</p>
<p>safe and sound inside Vee’s car, but now that I was alone, I</p>
<p>wasn’t feeling anywhere near as confident. I considered turning</p>
<p>on some Chopin to break the silence, but I didn’t want to</p>
<p>handicap my hearing. The last thing I needed was someone</p>
<p>sneaking up behind me….</p>
<p>Pull it together! I ordered myself. Nobody’s sneaking up on</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>After a while, when nothing good was left on TV, I climbed</p>
<p>upstairs to my bedroom. My room was, for all intents and</p>
<p>purposes, clean, so I color-coded my closet, trying to keep</p>
<p>myself busy so I wouldn’t be tempted to fall asleep. Nothing</p>
<p>would make me as vulnerable as dozing off, and I wanted to</p>
<p>delay it as long as possible. I dusted the top of the bureau, then</p>
<p>alphabetized my hardcovers. I reassured myself that nothing</p>
<p>bad was going to happen. Most likely, I’d wake tomorrow</p>
<p>realizing how ridiculously paranoid I’d been.</p>
<p>Then again, maybe the text was from someone who wanted</p>
<p>to slit my throat while I slept. On an eerie night like this, nothing</p>
<p>was too far-fetched to believe.</p>
<p>Sometime later, I woke in the dark. The drapes on the far</p>
<p>side of the room billowed as the electric fan oscillated toward</p>
<p>them. The air temperature was overly warm, and my stretchy</p>
<p>tank and boy briefs clung to my skin, but I was too caught up in</p>
<p>envisioning worst-case scenarios to even think about cracking</p>
<p>the window. Looking sideways, I blinked at the numbers on my</p>
<p>clock. Just shy of three.</p>
<p>An angry pounding reverberated through the right side of my</p>
<p>skull, and my eye was swollen shut. Turning on every light in the</p>
<p>house, I padded barefoot to the freezer and assembled an ice</p>
<p>pack out of ice cubes and a Ziploc bag. I braved a look in the</p>
<p>bathroom mirror and groaned. A violent purple and red bruise</p>
<p>flowered from my eyebrow down to my cheekbone.</p>
<p>“How could you have let this happen?” I asked my reflection.</p>
<p>“How could you have let Marcie beat you up?”</p>
<p>I shook the last two Tylenol gelcaps out of the bottle in the</p>
<p>mirrored cabinet, swallowed them, then curled into bed. The ice</p>
<p>stung the skin around my eye and sent a shiver through me. While I waited for the Tylenol to kick in, I wrestled with the</p>
<p>mental picture of Marcie climbing inside Patch’s Jeep. The</p>
<p>image played, rewound, and replayed. I tossed and turned, and</p>
<p>even folded my pillow over my head to smother the image, but it</p>
<p>danced just out of reach, taunting me. What must have been an hour later, my brain wore itself out</p>
<p>thinking of all the inventive ways I’d like to kill both Marcie and</p>
<p>thinking of all the inventive ways I’d like to kill both Marcie and</p>
<p>Patch, and I slipped back into sleep.</p>
<p>Iwoke to the sound of a lock rolling over.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes, but found my vision muddled by the same</p>
<p>poor-quality black and white as when I’d dreamed my way into</p>
<p>England, hundreds of years ago. I tried to blink it away and</p>
<p>bring my normal vision back, but my world stayed the color of</p>
<p>smoke and ice.</p>
<p>Downstairs, the front door eased open with a low-pitched</p>
<p>creak.</p>
<p>I wasn’t expecting my mom home until Saturday morning,</p>
<p>which meant it was someone else. Someone who didn’t belong</p>
<p>inside.</p>
<p>I stole a look around the room for something I could use as a</p>
<p>weapon.A few small picture frames were arranged on the nightstand,</p>
<p>along with a cheap drugstore lamp.</p>
<p>Footsteps trod softly over the hardwood floors of the foyer.</p>
<p>Seconds later, they were on the stairs. The intruder didn’t</p>
<p>pause, listening for signs that they’d been heard. They knew</p>
<p>exactly where they were going. Rolling silently out of bed, I</p>
<p>snatched my discarded tights off the floor. I tightened them</p>
<p>between my hands and pressed my back to the wall just inside</p>
<p>my bedroom door, a clammy sweat beading my skin. It was so</p>
<p>quiet I could hear myself breathe.</p>
<p>He stepped through the doorway, and I roped a leg of the</p>
<p>tights around his neck, tugging back with all my strength. There</p>
<p>was a moment of struggle before my weight jerked forward and</p>
<p>I found myself face-to-face with Patch.</p>
<p>He looked from the tights he’d confiscated to me. “Want to</p>
<p>explain?”</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?” I demanded, my breathing</p>
<p>elevated. I put two and two together. “Was that your text earlier?</p>
<p>The one telling me to stay put tonight? Since when do you have</p>
<p>an unlisted number?”</p>
<p>“I had to get a new line. Something more secure.”</p>
<p>I didn’t want to know. What kind of person needed all that</p>
<p>secrecy? Who was Patch afraid would be eavesdropping on</p>
<p>his calls? The archangels?</p>
<p>“Did it ever occur to you to knock?” I said, my pulse still</p>
<p>hammering. “I thought you were someone else.”</p>
<p>“Expecting someone else?”</p>
<p>“As a matter of fact, yes!” A psychopath who sent anonymous</p>
<p>text messages telling me to make myself accessible.</p>
<p>“It’s after three,” Patch said. “Whoever you’re waiting for can’t</p>
<p>be that exciting—you fell asleep.” He smiled. “You’re still</p>
<p>sleeping.” As he said it, he looked satisfied. Maybe even</p>
<p>reassured, as if something he’d been puzzling over had finally</p>
<p>worked itself out.</p>
<p>I blinked. Still sleeping? What was he talking about? Wait. Of</p>
<p>course. That explained why all color was drained, and I was still</p>
<p>seeing in black and white. Patch wasn’t really in my bedroom —he was in my dream.</p>
<p>But was I dreaming about him, or did he actually know he</p>
<p>was here? Were we sharing the same dream?</p>
<p>“For your information, I fell asleep waiting for—Scott.” I had</p>
<p>no idea why I’d said it, other than my mouth got in the way of my</p>
<p>brain.</p>
<p>“Scott,” he repeated.</p>
<p>“Don’t start. I saw Marcie climb inside your Jeep.”</p>
<p>“She needed a ride.”</p>
<p>I adopted a hands-on-hips pose. “What kind of ride?”</p>
<p>“Not that kind of ride,” he said slowly.</p>
<p>“Oh, sure! What color was her thong?” It was a test, and I</p>
<p>really hoped he failed.</p>
<p>He didn’t answer, but one look at his eyes told me he hadn’t</p>
<p>failed.</p>
<p>I marched to the bed, grabbed a pillow, and hurled it at him.</p>
<p>He sidestepped, and it flopped against the wall. “You lied to</p>
<p>me,” I said. “You told me there was nothing going on between</p>
<p>you and Marcie, but when two people have nothing between</p>
<p>them, they don’t swap wardrobes, and they don’t get inside</p>
<p>each other’s cars late at night dressed in what could pass as</p>
<p>lingerie!” I was suddenly aware of my own clothes, or lack</p>
<p>thereof. I stood feet away from Patch in nothing more than a</p>
<p>spaghetti-strap tank and boy briefs. Well, there wasn’t a lot I</p>
<p>could do about it now, was there?</p>
<p>“Swap wardrobes?”</p>
<p>“She was wearing your hat!”</p>
<p>“She was having a bad hair day.”</p>
<p>My jaw dropped. “Is that what she told you? And you fell for</p>
<p>it?” “She’s not as bad as you’re making her out to be.”</p>
<p>He did not just say that.</p>
<p>I thrust a finger at my eye. “Not that bad? See this? She gave</p>
<p>it to me! What are you doing here?” I demanded again, my rage</p>
<p>boiling to an all-time high.</p>
<p>Patch leaned back against the bureau and folded his arms. “I</p>
<p>came by to see how you’re doing.”</p>
<p>“Again, I have a black eye, thanks for asking,” I snapped.</p>
<p>“Need ice?”</p>
<p>“I need you to get out of my dream!” I ripped a second pillow</p>
<p>off the bed and heaved it violently at him. This time he caught it.</p>
<p>“The Devil’s Handbag, black eye. Comes with the territory.”</p>
<p>He shoved the pillow back at me, as if to punctuate his opinion.</p>
<p>“Are you defending Marcie?”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “I don’t need to. She handled herself.</p>
<p>You, on the other hand …”</p>
<p>I pointed at the door. “Out.” When he didn’t move, I marched within range and whipped</p>
<p>the pillow against him. “I said get out of my dream, you lying,</p>
<p>traitorous—”</p>
<p>He wrestled the pillow out of my grasp and walked me</p>
<p>backward until I came up against the wall, his motorcycle boots</p>
<p>flush against my toes. I was drawing breath to finish my</p>
<p>sentence and call him the worst name I could think up, when</p>
<p>Patch tugged on the waistband of my underpants and pulled me</p>
<p>even closer. His eyes were liquid black, his breathing slow and</p>
<p>deep. I stood that way, suspended between him and the wall,</p>
<p>my pulse stepping up as I became more aware of his body and</p>
<p>the masculine scent of leather and mint lingering on his skin. I</p>
<p>felt my resistance start to ebb away.</p>
<p>Suddenly, and without heeding anything but my own desire, I</p>
<p>curled my fingers into his shirt and pulled him the rest of the way</p>
<p>against me. It felt so good to have him close again. I’d missed</p>
<p>him so much, but I hadn’t realized just how much until this</p>
<p>moment.</p>
<p>“Don’t make me regret this,” I said, breathless.</p>
<p>“You haven’t regretted me once.” He kissed me, and I</p>
<p>answered so hungrily I thought my lips would bruise. I pushed</p>
<p>my fingers up through his hair, clutching him closer. My mouth</p>
<p>was all over his, chaotic and wild and starved.All the messy and</p>
<p>complicated emotions I’d gone through since we broke up</p>
<p>dropped away as I drowned myself in the crazed and</p>
<p>compulsive need to be with him.</p>
<p>His hands were under my tank, expertly sliding to the small of</p>
<p>my back to hold me against him. Iwas trapped between the wall</p>
<p>and his body, fumbling at the buttons on his shirt, my knuckles</p>
<p>brushing solid muscle beneath.</p>
<p>I rucked his shirt down off his shoulders, slamming the door</p>
<p>on my brain, which warned that I was making a huge mistake. I</p>
<p>didn’t want to hear myself out, afraid of what I’d find on the other</p>
<p>side. I knew I was setting myself up for more pain, but I couldn’t</p>
<p>resist him. All I could think was that if Patch really was in my</p>
<p>dream, this whole night could be our secret. The archangels</p>
<p>couldn’t see us. Here, all their rules went up in smoke. We could</p>
<p>do whatever we wanted, and they would never find out. No one</p>
<p>would.</p>
<p>would.</p>
<p>Patch met me halfway, pulling his arms free from the sleeves</p>
<p>and tossing the shirt aside. I slid my hands along perfectly</p>
<p>sculpted muscle that sent a ripple of mania through me. I knew</p>
<p>he couldn’t feel any of this physically, but I told myself love was</p>
<p>driving him now. His love for me. I didn’t allow myself to think</p>
<p>about his inability to feel my touch, or how much or little this</p>
<p>encounter really meant to him. I simply wanted him. Now.</p>
<p>He lifted me up, and I wrapped my legs around his waist. I</p>
<p>saw his gaze cut to the dresser, then the bed, and my heart flipflopped</p>
<p>with desire. Rational thought had abandoned me. All I</p>
<p>knew was that I would do whatever it took to hang on to this</p>
<p>unhinged high. Everything was happening way too fast, but the</p>
<p>wild certainty of where we were headed was a balm to the cold,</p>
<p>destructive anger I’d felt simmering under the surface the past</p>
<p>week.</p>
<p>It was the last thought I registered before my fingertip</p>
<p>brushed the place where his wings connected to his back.</p>
<p>Before I could stop it, I was sucked inside his memory in a</p>
<p>snap.</p>
<p>The smell of leather, and the smooth, slippery feel of it against</p>
<p>the underside of my thighs, told me I was in Patch’s Jeep even</p>
<p>before my eyes had fully adapted to the darkness. I was in the</p>
<p>backseat, with Patch behind the wheel and Marcie in the</p>
<p>passenger seat. She was wearing the same slinky dress and</p>
<p>tall boots I’d seen her in less than three hours ago.</p>
<p>Tonight, then. Patch’s memory had whisked me only a few</p>
<p>hours back.</p>
<p>“She ruined my dress,” Marcie said, picking at the fabric</p>
<p>clinging to her thighs. “Now I’m freezing. And I reek of cherry</p>
<p>Coke.”</p>
<p>“You want my jacket?” Patch asked, eyes on the road.</p>
<p>“Where is it?”</p>
<p>“Backseat.”</p>
<p>Marcie unlocked her seat belt, got a knee up on the console,</p>
<p>and grabbed Patch’s leather jacket off the seat beside me. When she was facing forward again, she tugged the dress up</p>
<p>over her head and dropped it on the floor at her feet. Other than</p>
<p>her underwear, she was completely naked.</p>
<p>Imade a little choked sound in my throat.</p>
<p>She threaded her arms into Patch’s jacket and zipped it up.</p>
<p>“Take the next left,” she instructed.</p>
<p>“I know the way to your house,” Patch said, steering the Jeep</p>
<p>right.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to go home. In two blocks, turn left.”</p>
<p>But after two blocks, Patch continued straight.</p>
<p>“Well, you’re no fun,” Marcie said with a jaded pout. “Aren’t</p>
<p>you just a little bit curious where Iwas going to take us?”</p>
<p>“It’s late.”</p>
<p>“Are you turning me down?” she asked coyly.</p>
<p>“I’m dropping you off, then I’m going back to my place.”</p>
<p>“Why can’t I come?”</p>
<p>“Maybe someday,” Patch said.</p>
<p>Oh, really? Iwanted to snap at Patch.</p>
<p>That’s more than I ever got!</p>
<p>“That’s not very specific,” Marcie smirked, kicking her heels</p>
<p>up on the dash, showing off inches of leg.</p>
<p>Patch said nothing.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow night, then,” Marcie said. She paused and</p>
<p>continued in a velvety voice, “It’s not like you have somewhere</p>
<p>else to be. I know Nora broke up with you.”</p>
<p>Patch’s hands tightened on the steering wheel.</p>
<p>“I heard she’s with Scott Parnell now. You know, the new guy.</p>
<p>He’s cute, but she traded down.”</p>
<p>“I don’t really want to talk about Nora.”</p>
<p>“Good, because neither do I. Iwant to talk about us.”</p>
<p>“I thought you had a boyfriend.”</p>
<p>“The key word in that sentence is had.”</p>
<p>Patch took a short right, bouncing the Jeep into Marcie’s</p>
<p>driveway. He didn’t cut the engine. “Good night, Marcie.”</p>
<p>She stayed in her seat a moment, then laughed. “You’re not</p>
<p>going to walk me to the door?”</p>
<p>“You’re a strong, capable girl.”</p>
<p>“If my daddy’s watching, he won’t be happy,” she said,</p>
<p>reaching over to straighten Patch’s collar, her hand lingering</p>
<p>longer than was appropriate.</p>
<p>“He’s not watching.”</p>
<p>“How do you know?”</p>
<p>“Trust me.”</p>
<p>Marcie lowered her voice further, sultry and smooth. “You</p>
<p>know, Ireally admire your willpower. You keep me guessing, and</p>
<p>I like that. But let me make one thing perfectly clear. I’m not</p>
<p>looking for a relationship. I don’t like messy, complicated things.</p>
<p>I don’t want hurt feelings, confusing signals, or jealousy—I just</p>
<p>want fun. I’m looking for a good time. Think about it.”</p>
<p>For the first time, Patch turned to face Marcie. “I’ll keep that</p>
<p>in mind,” he said at last.</p>
<p>From her profile, I saw Marcie smile. She leaned across the</p>
<p>console and gave Patch a slow, hot kiss. He started to pull</p>
<p>back, then stopped. At any moment, he could have broken the</p>
<p>kiss off, but he didn’t.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow night,” Marcie murmured, pulling away at last.</p>
<p>“Your place.”</p>
<p>“Your dress,” he told her, gesturing at the damp heap on the</p>
<p>floor.</p>
<p>“Wash it and give it back to me tomorrow night.” She pushed</p>
<p>her way out of the Jeep and ran up to her front door, where she</p>
<p>slipped inside.</p>
<p>My arms went slack around Patch’s neck. I felt too slapped by</p>
<p>what I’d seen to form a single word. It was as if he’d thrown a</p>
<p>bucket of ice water on me. My lips were swollen from the</p>
<p>roughness of his kiss, my heart just as inflamed.</p>
<p>Patch was in my dream. We were sharing it together.</p>
<p>Somehow it was real. The whole idea was eerily surreal,</p>
<p>bordering on impossible, but it had to be true. If he wasn’t here,</p>
<p>if he hadn’t injected himself quietly and stealthily into my dream,</p>
<p>I couldn’t have touched his scars and been catapulted into his</p>
<p>memory.</p>
<p>But I had. The memory was living, valid, and all too real.</p>
<p>Patch could tell by my reaction that whatever I’d seen wasn’t</p>
<p>good. His arms bracketed my shoulders, and he tipped his</p>
<p>head back to stare at the ceiling. “What did you see?” he asked</p>
<p>quietly.</p>
<p>The sound of my heart pounded between us.</p>
<p>“You kissed Marcie,” I said, biting my lip hard to stall the tears</p>
<p>welling up.</p>
<p>He dragged his hands down his face, then squeezed the</p>
<p>bridge of his nose.</p>
<p>“Tell me it’s a mind game. Tell me it’s a trick. Tell me she has</p>
<p>some kind of power over you, that you don’t have any choice</p>
<p>when it comes to being with her.”</p>
<p>“It’s complicated.”</p>
<p>“No,” I said with a fierce shake of my head. “Don’t tell me it’s</p>
<p>complicated. Nothing is complicated anymore—not after</p>
<p>everything we’ve been through. What do you even hope to get</p>
<p>out of a relationship with her?”</p>
<p>His eyes flicked to mine. “Not love.”</p>
<p>A certain emptiness gnawed its way inside me. All the</p>
<p>pieces came together, and I suddenly understood. Being with</p>
<p>Marcie was about cheap satisfaction. Self-satisfaction. He</p>
<p>really did see us as conquests. He was a player. Every girl was</p>
<p>a new challenge, a short-term hookup to broaden his horizons.</p>
<p>He found success in the art of seduction. He didn’t care about</p>
<p>the middle or end of a story— only the beginning. And just like</p>
<p>all the other girls, I’d made the huge mistake of falling in love</p>
<p>with him. The moment I did, he ran. Well, he’d never have to</p>
<p>worry about Marcie confessing her love. The only person she</p>
<p>loved was herself.</p>
<p>“You make me sick,” I said, my voice trembling with</p>
<p>accusation.</p>
<p>Patch crouched down, elbows on his knees, face buried in</p>
<p>his hands. “I didn’t come here to hurt you.”</p>
<p>“Why did you come? To fool around behind the archangels’</p>
<p>backs? To hurt me more than you already have?” I didn’t wait for</p>
<p>an answer. Reaching for my neck, I yanked at the silver chain</p>
<p>he’d given me days ago. It snapped free at the back of my neck</p>
<p>hard enough that I should have winced, but I was in too much</p>
<p>pain to notice a little more. I should have made him take the</p>
<p>chain back the day I called it quits between us, but I realized a</p>
<p>little late that up until this moment, I hadn’t given up hope. I’d still</p>
<p>believed in us. I’d clung to the belief that there was still a way to</p>
<p>cut a deal with the stars that would bring Patch back to me. What an utter waste.</p>
<p>I flung the chain at him. “And Iwant my ring back.”</p>
<p>His dark eyes stayed settled on me a moment longer, then</p>
<p>he bent and scooped up his shirt. “No.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean no? Iwant it back!”</p>
<p>“You gave it to me,” he said quietly, but not gently.</p>
<p>“Well, I changed my mind!” My face was flushed, my whole</p>
<p>body hot with rage. He was keeping the ring because he knew</p>
<p>how much it meant to me. He was keeping it, because despite</p>
<p>his rise in stature to guardian angel, his soul was just as black</p>
<p>his rise in stature to guardian angel, his soul was just as black</p>
<p>as it had been the day I met him. And the biggest mistake I’d</p>
<p>ever made was fooling myself into believing otherwise. “I gave it</p>
<p>to you when Iwas stupid enough to think I loved you!” I thrust out</p>
<p>my hand. “Give it back. Now.” I couldn’t stand the thought of</p>
<p>losing my dad’s ring to Patch. He didn’t deserve it. He didn’t</p>
<p>deserve to keep the one tangible reminder I had of real love.</p>
<p>Ignoring my request, Patch walked out.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes.</p>
<p>I clicked on the lamp, my vision returning to full color. I sat up,</p>
<p>a hot flash of adrenaline warming my skin. Reaching for my</p>
<p>neck, I felt for Patch’s silver chain, but it wasn’t there. I swept my</p>
<p>hand across the wrinkled sheets, thinking it had fallen off while I</p>
<p>slept.</p>
<p>But the chain was gone.</p>
<p>The dream was real.</p>
<p>Patch had discovered a way to visit me while I slept.</p><p>

<p></p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>MONDAYAFTER SCHOOL, VEE DROPPED ME off at the library. I took a</p>
<p>moment outside the entrance to call my mom for our daily</p>
<p>check-in.As usual, she told me work was keeping her busy, and</p>
<p>I told her school was doing the same thing for me.</p>
<p>Inside, I took the elevator to the media lab on the third floor,</p>
<p>checked my e-mail, browsed Facebook, and scanned Perez</p>
<p>Hilton. Just to torture myself, I Googled the Black Hand again.</p>
<p>The same links popped up. I hadn’t really expected anything</p>
<p>new, had I? Finally, with nowhere left to procrastinate, I flipped</p>
<p>open my chemistry text and resigned myself to studying.</p>
<p>It was late by the time I called it quits to go hunt down a</p>
<p>vending machine. Out the library’s west-facing windows, the sun</p>
<p>was tucked deep in the horizon, and night was closing in fast. I</p>
<p>bypassed the elevator in favor of the stairs, feeling the need for</p>
<p>a little exercise. I’d been sitting so long, my legs were beginning</p>
<p>to tingle with sleep.</p>
<p>In the lobby, I fed a few dollars to the vending machine and</p>
<p>carried pretzels and a can of cranberry juice back to the third</p>
<p>floor. When I returned to the media lab, Vee was sitting on my</p>
<p>desk, her glossy yellow high heels propped on my chair. Her</p>
<p>expression was a mix of smug amusement and annoyance.</p>
<p>She held a small black envelope in the air, caught between two</p>
<p>of her fingers.</p>
<p>“This is for you,” she said, tossing the envelope on the desk.</p>
<p>“And so’s this.” She held out a paper bakery bag, rolled at the</p>
<p>neck. “Thought you might be hungry.”</p>
<p>Judging by the disdain in Vee’s expression, I had a bad</p>
<p>feeling about the card, and took the opportunity to give my</p>
<p>attention to what was inside the bag. “Cupcakes!”</p>
<p>Vee grinned. “The bakery lady told me they’re organic. Not</p>
<p>sure how you make an organic cupcake, and not sure why they</p>
<p>cost extra, but there you go.”</p>
<p>“You’re my hero.”</p>
<p>“How much longer do you think you’ll be?”</p>
<p>“Thiry minutes, tops.”</p>
<p>She laid the keys to the Neon next to my backpack. “Rixon</p>
<p>and I are going to grab something to eat, so you’ll have to be</p>
<p>your own chauffeur tonight. I parked the Neon in the</p>
<p>underground garage. Row B. I only have a fourth of a tank left,</p>
<p>so don’t go crazy.”</p>
<p>I took the keys, trying to ignore the unpleasant sting in my</p>
<p>heart that I instantly recognized as jealousy. I was jealous of</p>
<p>Vee’s new relationship with Rixon. Jealous of her dinner plans.</p>
<p>Jealous that she was now closer to Patch than I was, because</p>
<p>even though Vee had never mentioned it, I was sure she</p>
<p>bumped into Patch when she was with Rixon. For all I knew, the</p>
<p>three of them watched movies together at night. The three of</p>
<p>them, lounging on Rixon’s sofa, while I sat in the farmhouse</p>
<p>alone. I desperately wanted to ask Vee about Patch, but the</p>
<p>alone. I desperately wanted to ask Vee about Patch, but the</p>
<p>truth of the matter was, I couldn’t. I’d broken up with him. I’d</p>
<p>made my bed, and it was time to lie in it.</p>
<p>Then again, how was one little inquiry going to hurt?</p>
<p>“Hey, Vee?”</p>
<p>She turned back at the door. “Yeah?”</p>
<p>I opened my mouth, and that was when I remembered my</p>
<p>pride. Vee was my best friend, but she also had a big mouth. If I</p>
<p>asked about Patch, I risked him hearing about it secondhand.</p>
<p>He’d find out just how hard a time Iwas having getting over him.</p>
<p>I pulled on a smile. “Thanks for the cupcakes.”</p>
<p>“Anything for you, babe.”</p>
<p>After Vee left, I peeled back the paper wrapping on one of</p>
<p>the cupcakes and ate alone in the quiet mechanical hum of the</p>
<p>lab.</p>
<p>I did another half hour of homework, and ate two more</p>
<p>cupcakes, before I finally dared a look at the black envelope</p>
<p>sitting at the edge of my vision. I knew I couldn’t avoid it all night.</p>
<p>Breaking the seal, I shook out a black card with a small heart</p>
<p>embossed at the center. The word sorry was scripted across it.</p>
<p>The card was scented with a bittersweet perfume. I raised the</p>
<p>card to my nose and breathed deeply, trying to the place the</p>
<p>strangely intoxicating scent. The smell of burned fruit and</p>
<p>chemical spices stung all the way down the back of my throat. I</p>
<p>opened the card.</p>
<p>I was a jerk last night. Forgive me?</p>
<p>Automatically I slid the card an arm’s length away. Patch. I</p>
<p>didn’t know what to make of his apology, but I didn’t like the</p>
<p>commotion it caused inside me. Yes, he’d been a jerk. And did</p>
<p>he think a card from the drugstore could negate it? If so, he was</p>
<p>underestimating the damage he’d caused. He’d kissed Marcie.</p>
<p>Kissed her! And not only that, but he’d invaded my dreams. I</p>
<p>had no idea how he’d done it, but when I woke in the morning, I</p>
<p>knew he’d been there. It was more than a little unnerving. If he</p>
<p>could invade the privacy of my dreams, what else could he do?</p>
<p>“Ten minutes until closing,” a librarian whispered from the</p>
<p>doorway.</p>
<p>I sent my three-paragraph essay on amino acids to the</p>
<p>printer, then scooped up my books and wedged them inside my</p>
<p>backpack. I picked up Patch’s card, hesitated once, then</p>
<p>ripped it multiple times and tossed the scraps into the trash</p>
<p>can. If he wanted to say sorry, he could do it in person. Not</p>
<p>through Vee, and not in my dreams.</p>
<p>Halfway down the aisle to pick up my print job, I reached out</p>
<p>to steady myself on the nearest desk. The right side of my body</p>
<p>felt heavier than the left, and my balance wavered. I took</p>
<p>another step, and my right leg crumpled, as if made of paper. I</p>
<p>crouched down, gripping the desk with both hands, tucking my</p>
<p>head between my elbows to get blood flowing to my brain</p>
<p>again.A warm, drowsy feeling swirled through my veins.</p>
<p>Straightening my legs, I came to a wobbly stand, but</p>
<p>something was wrong with the walls. They were stretched</p>
<p>abnormally long and narrow, as if I was looking at them through</p>
<p>a mirror at a fun house. I blinked hard several times, attempting</p>
<p>to bring my vision to a focal point.</p>
<p>My bones filled with iron, refusing to move, and my eyelids</p>
<p>sank against the stark fluorescent lights. In a panic, I ordered</p>
<p>them open, but my body overruled all. I felt warm fingers curl</p>
<p>around my mind, threatening to drag it off to sleep.</p>
<p>The perfume, I thought vaguely. In Patch’s card.</p>
<p>I was on my hands and knees now. Strange rectangles</p>
<p>wavered all around, spinning before me. Doors. The room was</p>
<p>lined with open doors. But the faster I crawled toward them, the</p>
<p>faster they jumped back. Off in the distance, I heard a somber</p>
<p>tick-tock. I moved away from the sound, lucid enough to know</p>
<p>that the clock was at the back of the room, opposite the door.</p>
<p>Moments later, I realized that my arms and legs were no</p>
<p>longer moving, the sensation of crawling nothing more than an</p>
<p>illusion in my head. Scratchy, industrial-grade carpet cushioned</p>
<p>my cheek. I fought once more to push myself up, then shut my</p>
<p>eyes, all light spiraling away.</p>
<p>Iwoke in the dark.</p>
<p>Artificially cool air tingled my skin, and the quiet hum of</p>
<p>machines whispered all around. I got my hands under me, but</p>
<p>when I tried to raise myself up, dots of purple and black danced</p>
<p>across my vision. I swallowed the texture of cotton thick in my</p>
<p>mouth and rolled onto my back.</p>
<p>That was when Iremembered Iwas still in the library.At least,</p>
<p>I was pretty sure that’s where I was. I didn’t remember leaving.</p>
<p>But what was I doing on the floor? I tried to remember how I got</p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>Patch’s card. I’d breathed in the tangy, bitter perfume. Shortly</p>
<p>after, I’d collapsed on the floor.</p>
<p>Had I been drugged?</p>
<p>Had Patch drugged me?</p>
<p>I lay there, heart thumping, eyes blinking so rapidly the blinks</p>
<p>came one on top of the other. I tried to get up a second time, but</p>
<p>it felt as if someone had a steel boot planted in the center of my</p>
<p>chest. With a second, more determined heave, I pulled myself</p>
<p>to sitting. Clinging to a desk, I dragged myself all the way to</p>
<p>standing. My brain protested the vertigo, but my eyes located</p>
<p>the blurry green exit sign above the media lab door. I tottered</p>
<p>over.</p>
<p>I turned the handle. The door opened an inch, then caught. I</p>
<p>was about to tug harder, when something on the other side of</p>
<p>the window set in the door caught my eye. I frowned. That’s</p>
<p>weird. Someone had tied one end of a length of rope to the</p>
<p>outer door handle, and the other end to the handle of the door</p>
<p>one room down.</p>
<p>I smacked my hand against the glass. “Hello?” I shouted</p>
<p>groggily. “Can anyone hear me?”</p>
<p>I tried the door again, pulling with all my might, which wasn’t</p>
<p>much, since my muscles seemed to melt like hot butter the</p>
<p>minute I tried to exert them. The rope was strung so tight</p>
<p>between the two handles, I could only bring the lab door roughly</p>
<p>five inches out of the frame. Not nearly enough to squeeze</p>
<p>through.</p>
<p>“Is anyone there?” I shouted through the door crack. “I’m</p>
<p>trapped on the third floor!”</p>
<p>The library answered with silence.</p>
<p>My eyes were fully adapted to the darkness now, and I found</p>
<p>the clock on the wall. Eleven? Could that be right? Had I really</p>
<p>slept more than two hours?</p>
<p>I pulled out my cell, but there was no signal. I tried to log on to</p>
<p>the Internet but was repeatedly informed that there were no</p>
<p>available networks.</p>
<p>Looking frantically around the media lab, I combed my eyes</p>
<p>over every object, searching for something I could use to get</p>
<p>out. Computers, swivel chairs, filing cabinets … nothing jumped</p>
<p>out at me. I knelt down beside the floor vent and shouted, “Can</p>
<p>anyone hear me? I’m trapped in the media lab on the third</p>
<p>floor!” I waited, praying to hear a response. My one hope was</p>
<p>that there was still a librarian around, finishing up last-minute</p>
<p>work before heading out. But it was an hour shy of midnight,</p>
<p>and I knew the odds were stacked against me.</p>
<p>Out in the main library, gears clanked into motion as the</p>
<p>cage elevator at the end of the hall rose up from the ground</p>
<p>level. I jerked my head toward the sound.</p>
<p>Once, when I was four or five, my dad took me to the park to</p>
<p>teach me how to ride my bike without training wheels. By the</p>
<p>end of the afternoon, I could ride all the way around the quartermile</p>
<p>loop without help. My dad gave me a big hug and told me it</p>
<p>was time to go home and show my mom. I begged for two more</p>
<p>loops, and we compromised on one. Halfway around the loop, I</p>
<p>lost my balance and tipped over. As I was righting my bike, I</p>
<p>saw a big brown dog not far off. It was staring at me. In that</p>
<p>moment, as we stood watching each other, I heard a voice</p>
<p>whisper, Don’t move. I gulped a breath and held it, even though</p>
<p>my legs wanted to run as fast as they could to the safety of my</p>
<p>dad.</p>
<p>The dog’s ears pricked and he started toward me in an</p>
<p>aggressive lope. I shivered with fear but kept my feet rooted.</p>
<p>The closer the dog came, the more I wanted to run, but I knew</p>
<p>the moment I moved, the dog’s animal instinct to chase would</p>
<p>kick in. Halfway to me, the dog lost interest in my statuelike</p>
<p>body and took off in a new direction. I asked my dad if he’d</p>
<p>heard the same voice telling me to hold still, and he said it was</p>
<p>instinct. If I listened to it, nine times out of ten I’d make the best</p>
<p>move.</p>
<p>Instinct was speaking now. Get out.</p>
<p>I grabbed a monitor off the closest desk and threw it against</p>
<p>the window. The glass smashed, leaving a huge hole in the</p>
<p>center. I snatched the three-hole punch off the community work</p>
<p>desk just inside the door and used it to knock out the remaining</p>
<p>glass. Then I dragged a chair over, climbed up, braced my shoe</p>
<p>on the window frame, and jumped out to the hall.</p>
<p>The elevator hissed and vibrated higher, passing the second</p>
<p>level.</p>
<p>I covered the hall in a sprint. I pumped my arms harder,</p>
<p>knowing I had to reach the stairwell, adjacent to the elevator,</p>
<p>before the elevator rose much higher and whoever was inside</p>
<p>saw me. I tugged on the stairwell door, expending several</p>
<p>precious seconds as I took the time to close it noiselessly</p>
<p>behind me. On the far side of the door, the elevator ground to a</p>
<p>halt. The retractable door rattled open and someone stepped</p>
<p>out. I used the railing to propel myself faster, keeping my shoes</p>
<p>light on the stairs. Iwas halfway down the second flight when the</p>
<p>stairwell door opened above me. I stopped mid-stride, not</p>
<p>wanting to alert whoever was up there to my location.</p>
<p>Nora?</p>
<p>My hand slipped on the railing. It was my dad’s voice.</p>
<p>Nora?Are you there?</p>
<p>I swallowed, wanting to cry out to him. Then I remembered</p>
<p>the townhouse.</p>
<p>Quit hiding. You can trust me. Let me help you. Come out</p>
<p>where I can see you.</p>
<p>His tone was strange and demanding. At the townhouse,</p>
<p>when my dad’s voice had first spoken to me, it was soft and</p>
<p>gentle. That same voice had told me we weren’t alone and I</p>
<p>needed to leave. When he spoke again, his voice was different.</p>
<p>It sounded forceful and deceiving. What if my dad had tried to</p>
<p>contact me? What if he’d been chased away, and the second,</p>
<p>strange voice was someone pretending to be him? I was struck</p>
<p>by the thought that someone could be impersonating my dad to</p>
<p>lure me close.</p>
<p>Heavy footsteps descended the stairs at a run, jerking me</p>
<p>out of my speculations. He was coming after me.</p>
<p>I clattered down the stairs, no longer worrying about keeping</p>
<p>quiet. Faster! I screamed to myself. Run faster!</p>
<p>He was gaining ground, barely more than a flight away. When</p>
<p>my shoes hit the ground level, I shoved through the stairwell</p>
<p>door, crossed the lobby, and flung myself out the front doors and</p>
<p>into the night.</p>
<p>The air was warm and quiet. I was running for the cement</p>
<p>steps leading down to the street, when I made a split-second</p>
<p>change of plans. I climbed the handrail to the left of the doors,</p>
<p>dropping ten or so feet to a small grassy courtyard below.</p>
<p>Above me, the library doors opened. I pressed back against the</p>
<p>cement wall, my feet stirring trash and tumbleweeds.</p>
<p>The minute I heard the slow tap of shoes descending the</p>
<p>cement steps, I raced down the block. The library didn’t have its</p>
<p>own parking; it shared an underground garage with the</p>
<p>courthouse. I ran down the parking ramp, ducked under the</p>
<p>parking arm, and swept the garage for the Neon. Where had</p>
<p>Vee said she’d parked?</p>
<p>RowB …</p>
<p>I ran one aisle over and saw the tail end of the Neon sticking</p>
<p>out of a space. I rammed the key into the door, dropped behind</p>
<p>the wheel, and cranked the engine. I’d just steered the Neon up</p>
<p>the exit ramp when a dark SUV swung around the corner. The</p>
<p>driver gunned the engine, heading straight for me.</p>
<p>I thrust the Neon into second gear and stepped on the gas,</p>
<p>pulling out in front of the SUV seconds before it would have</p>
<p>blocked the exit and boxed me inside the garage.</p>
<p>My mind was too frazzled to think clearly about where I was</p>
<p>going. I floored it down another two blocks, ran a stop sign, then</p>
<p>veered onto Walnut. The SUV accelerated onto Walnut behind</p>
<p>me, holding my tail. The speed limit jumped to forty-five, and the</p>
<p>lanes doubled to two. I pushed the Neon to fifty, switching my</p>
<p>eyes between the road and the rearview mirror. Without signaling, I yanked the steering wheel, cutting onto a</p>
<p>side street. The SUV razed the curb, following me. I took two</p>
<p>more right turns, circled the block, and got back on Walnut. I</p>
<p>swerved in front of a white two-door coupe, boxing it between</p>
<p>me and the SUV. The traffic light ahead turned yellow, and I</p>
<p>accelerated into the intersection as the light flashed red. With</p>
<p>my eyes glued to the rearview mirror, Iwatched the white car roll</p>
<p>to a stop. Behind it, the SUV came to a screeching halt.</p>
<p>I took several sharp breaths. My pulse throbbed in my arms,</p>
<p>and my hands were clamped tightly around the steering wheel.</p>
<p>I took Walnut uphill, but as soon as I was on the back side of</p>
<p>the hill, I crossed oncoming traffic and turned left. I bounced</p>
<p>over the railroad tracks, weaving my way through a dark,</p>
<p>dilapidated neighborhood of single-story brick houses. I knew</p>
<p>where I was: Slaughterville. The neighborhood had earned its</p>
<p>nickname over a decade ago when three teens gunned one</p>
<p>another down at a playground.</p>
<p>I slowed as a house set far back from the street caught my</p>
<p>attention. No lights. An open, empty detached garage stood at</p>
<p>the far back of the property. Ireversed the Neon up the driveway</p>
<p>and into the garage. After triple-checking that the door locks</p>
<p>were engaged, I killed the headlights. I waited, fearing that at</p>
<p>were engaged, I killed the headlights. I waited, fearing that at</p>
<p>any moment the SUV’s headlights would swing down the street.</p>
<p>Rummaging through my purse, I dug out my cell.</p>
<p>“Hey,” Vee answered.</p>
<p>“Who else touched the card from Patch?” I demanded, the</p>
<p>words rattling.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Did Patch give you the card directly? Did Rixon? Who else</p>
<p>touched it?”</p>
<p>“Want to tell me what this is about?”</p>
<p>“I think Iwas drugged.”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>“You think the card was drugged?” Vee repeated doubtfully at</p>
<p>last.</p>
<p>“The paper was laced with perfume,” I explained impatiently.</p>
<p>“Tell me who gave it to you. Tell me exactly how you got it.”</p>
<p>“On my way to the library to drop off the cupcakes, Rixon</p>
<p>called to see where Iwas,” she recounted slowly. “We met up at</p>
<p>the library, and Patch was riding shotgun in Rixon’s truck. Patch</p>
<p>gave me the card and asked if I’d give it to you. I took the card,</p>
<p>the cupcakes, and the Neon’s keys inside to you, then went</p>
<p>back out to meet Rixon.”</p>
<p>“Nobody else touched the card?”</p>
<p>“Nobody.”</p>
<p>“Less than a half hour after smelling the card, I collapsed on</p>
<p>the library floor. I didn’t wake up for two hours.”</p>
<p>Vee didn’t answer right away, and I could practically hear her</p>
<p>thinking everything through, trying to digest it. At last she said,</p>
<p>“Are you sure it wasn’t fatigue? You were in the library a long</p>
<p>time. I couldn’t work that long on homework without needing a</p>
<p>nap.”</p>
<p>“When I woke up,” I pushed on, “someone was in the library</p>
<p>with me. I think it was the same person who drugged me. They</p>
<p>chased me through the library. I got out, but they followed me</p>
<p>down Walnut.”</p>
<p>Another baffled pause. “As much as I don’t like Patch, I’ve</p>
<p>got to tell you, I can’t see him drugging you. He’s a whack job,</p>
<p>but he does have boundaries.”</p>
<p>“Then who?” My voice was a little shrill.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Where are you now?”</p>
<p>“Slaughterville.”</p>
<p>“What? Get out of there before you get mugged! Come over.</p>
<p>Stay the night here. We’ll work this out. We’ll figure out what</p>
<p>happened.” But the words felt like an empty consolation. Vee</p>
<p>was just as perplexed as Iwas.</p>
<p>I stayed hidden in the garage for what must have been another</p>
<p>twenty minutes before I felt brave enough to go back on the</p>
<p>streets. My nerves were frayed, my mind reeling. I opted against</p>
<p>taking Walnut, thinking the SUV might be cruising up and down</p>
<p>it right now, waiting to pick up my tail. Sticking to side streets, I</p>
<p>ignored the speed limit and drove in a reckless hurry to Vee’s.</p>
<p>I wasn’t far from her house when I noticed blue and red lights</p>
<p>in the rearview mirror.</p>
<p>Stopping the Neon at the side of the road, I planted my head</p>
<p>against the steering wheel. I knew I’d been speeding, and I was</p>
<p>frustrated at myself for doing it, but of all the nights to get pulled</p>
<p>over.</p>
<p>A moment later, knuckles rapped the window. I pushed the</p>
<p>button to lower it.</p>
<p>“Well, well,” Detective Basso said. “Long time no see.”</p>
<p>Any other cop, I thought. Any other.</p>
<p>He flashed his ticket pad. “License and registration, you</p>
<p>know the drill.”</p>
<p>Since I knew there was no talking my way around a ticket, not</p>
<p>with Detective Basso, I didn’t see the point in putting on any</p>
<p>pretense of contrition. “I didn’t know detective work included</p>
<p>filling out speeding tickets.”</p>
<p>He gave a razorthin smile. “Where’s the fire?”</p>
<p>“Can I just get my ticket and go home?”</p>
<p>“Any alcohol in the car?”</p>
<p>“Have a look around,” I said, spreading my hands.</p>
<p>He opened the door for me. “Get out.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Get out” —he pointed at the dashed line bisecting the</p>
<p>road— “and walk the line.”</p>
<p>“You think I’m drunk?”</p>
<p>“I think you’re crazy, but I’m checking your sobriety while I’ve</p>
<p>got you here.”</p>
<p>I swung out and slammed the door shut behind me. “How</p>
<p>far?”</p>
<p>“Until I tell you to stop.”</p>
<p>I concentrated on planting my feet on the line, but every time I</p>
<p>looked down, my vision slanted. I could still feel the effects of</p>
<p>the drug pecking away at my coordination, and the harder I</p>
<p>concentrated on keeping my feet on the line, the more I felt</p>
<p>myself swaying off into the road. “Can’t you just give me the</p>
<p>ticket, slap my wrist, and send me home?” My tone was</p>
<p>insubordinate, but I’d gone cold on the inside. If I couldn’t walk</p>
<p>the line, Detective Basso might throw me in jail. I was already</p>
<p>shaken, and I didn’t think I could handle a night behind bars. What if the man from the library came after me again?</p>
<p>“A lot of small-town cops would let you off the hook like that,</p>
<p>sure. Some would even take a bribe. I’m not one of them.”</p>
<p>“Does it matter that Iwas drugged?”</p>
<p>He laughed darkly. “Drugged.”</p>
<p>“My ex-boyfriend gave me a card laced with perfume earlier</p>
<p>tonight. I opened the card, and the next thing I knew, I passed</p>
<p>out.”When Detective Basso didn’t interrupt me, I pressed</p>
<p>forward. “I slept for more than two hours. When I woke up, the</p>
<p>library was closed. Iwas locked in the media lab. Someone had</p>
<p>tied the doorknob….” I trailed off, closing my mouth.</p>
<p>He gestured for more. “Come on, now. Don’t leave me at that</p>
<p>cliffhanger.”</p>
<p>I realized a moment too late that I’d just incriminated myself.</p>
<p>I’d put myself at the library, tonight, in the media lab. First thing</p>
<p>tomorrow, when the library opened, they were going to report</p>
<p>the broken window to the police. And I had no doubt who</p>
<p>Detective Basso would come looking for first.</p>
<p>Detective Basso would come looking for first.</p>
<p>“You were in the media lab,” he prompted. “What happened</p>
<p>next?”</p>
<p>Too late to back out now. I’d have to finish and hope for the</p>
<p>best. Maybe something I said would convince Detective Basso</p>
<p>it wasn’t my fault—that everything I’d done was justified.</p>
<p>“Someone had tied the door to the media lab shut. I threw a</p>
<p>computer through the window to get out.”</p>
<p>He tipped his head back and laughed. “There’s a name for</p>
<p>girls like you, Nora Grey. Crazy makers. You’re like the fly that</p>
<p>nobody can shoo away.” He walked back to his patrol car and</p>
<p>stretched the radio out the open driver’s-side door. Radioing</p>
<p>dispatch, he said, “I need someone to swing by the library and</p>
<p>check out the media lab. Let me know what you find.”</p>
<p>He leaned back against his car, eyes flicking to his watch.</p>
<p>“How many minutes do you think it’ll take for them to get back to</p>
<p>me? I’ve got your confession, Nora. I could book you for</p>
<p>trespassing and vandalism.”</p>
<p>“Trespassing would imply I wasn’t tied inside the library</p>
<p>against my will.” I sounded nervous.</p>
<p>“If someone drugged you and trapped you in the lab, what</p>
<p>are you doing here now, roaring down Hickory at fifty-five miles</p>
<p>an hour?”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t supposed to get away. I broke out of the room while</p>
<p>he was coming up the elevator to get me.”</p>
<p>“He? You saw him? Let’s have a description.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t see him, but it was a guy. His footsteps were heavy</p>
<p>when he came down the stairwell after me. Too heavy for a girl.”</p>
<p>“You’re stammering. Usually that means you’re lying.”</p>
<p>“I’m not lying. Iwas tied in the lab, and someone was coming</p>
<p>up the elevator to get me.”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>“Who else would have been in the building that late?” I</p>
<p>snapped.</p>
<p>“A janitor?” he offered easily.</p>
<p>“He wasn’t dressed like a janitor. When I looked up in the</p>
<p>stairwell, I saw dark pants and dark tennis shoes.”</p>
<p>“So when I take you to court, you’re going to tell the judge</p>
<p>you’re an expert on janitorial apparel?”</p>
<p>“The guy followed me out of the library, got into his car, and</p>
<p>chased me.A janitor wouldn’t do that.”</p>
<p>The radio popped with static, and Detective Basso leaned</p>
<p>inside for the receiver.</p>
<p>“Finished walking through the library,” a man’s voice crackled</p>
<p>through the radio. “Nothing.”</p>
<p>Detective Basso cut cool, suspicious eyes to me. “Nothing?</p>
<p>You sure?”</p>
<p>“Irepeat: nothing.”</p>
<p>Nothing? Instead of relief, I felt panic. I’d smashed the lab</p>
<p>window. I had. It was real. It wasn’t my imagination. It—wasn’t.</p>
<p>Calm down! I ordered myself. This had happened before. It</p>
<p>wasn’t new. In the past, it was always a mind game. It was</p>
<p>someone working behind the scenes, trying to manipulate my</p>
<p>mind. Was it happening all over again? But … why? I needed to</p>
<p>think this through. I shook my head, ridiculously wishing the</p>
<p>gesture would shake out an answer.</p>
<p>Detective Basso ripped the top sheet off his ticket pad and</p>
<p>slapped it into my hand.</p>
<p>My eyes brushed over the balance at the bottom. “Two</p>
<p>hundred and twenty-nine dollars?!”</p>
<p>“You were going thirty over and driving a car that doesn’t</p>
<p>belong to you. Pay the fine, or I’ll see you in court.”</p>
<p>“I—I don’t have this kind of money.”</p>
<p>“Get a job. Maybe it’ll keep you out of trouble.”</p>
<p>“Please don’t do this,” I said, injecting all the pleading that I</p>
<p>possessed into my voice.</p>
<p>Detective Basso studied me. “Two months ago a kid with no</p>
<p>ID, no family, and no traceable past wound up dead in the high</p>
<p>school gym.”</p>
<p>“Jules’s death was ruled a suicide,” I said automatically, but</p>
<p>sweat tingled the back of my neck. What did this have to do with</p>
<p>my ticket?</p>
<p>“The same night he disappeared, the high school counselor</p>
<p>lit your house on fire, then did her own disappearing act.</p>
<p>There’s a link between these two bizarre incidents.” His dark</p>
<p>brown eyes pinned me in place. “You.”</p>
<p>“What are you saying?”</p>
<p>“Tell me what really happened that night, and I can make your</p>
<p>ticket go away.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what happened,” I lied, because there was no</p>
<p>alternative. Telling the truth would leave me worse off than</p>
<p>having to pay the ticket. I couldn’t tell Detective Basso about</p>
<p>fallen angels and Nephilim. He’d never believe my story if I</p>
<p>fallen angels and Nephilim. He’d never believe my story if I</p>
<p>confessed that Dabria was an angel of death. Or that Jules was</p>
<p>a descendant of a fallen angel.</p>
<p>“Your call,” Detective Basso said, flicking his business card</p>
<p>at me before folding himself inside his car. “If you change your</p>
<p>mind, you know how to reach me.”</p>
<p>I glanced at the card as he roared off. DETECTIVE ECANUS</p>
<p>BASSO. 207-555-3333.</p>
<p>The ticket felt heavy in my hand. Heavy, and hot. How was I</p>
<p>going to come up with two hundred dollars? I couldn’t borrow</p>
<p>the money from my mom—she could barely afford groceries.</p>
<p>Patch had the money, but I’d told him I could take care of myself.</p>
<p>I’d told him to get out of my life. What did it say about me if I ran</p>
<p>back to him the moment I hit trouble? It was admitting he’d been</p>
<p>right all along.</p>
<p>It was admitting I needed him.</p><p>

<p></p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>TUESDAYAFTER CLASS, I WAS ON MYWAYOUTOF the building to meet</p>
<p>Vee, who’d skipped class to hang out with Rixon but promised</p>
<p>to swing back by school at noon to chauffeur me home, when</p>
<p>my cell phone chirped. I opened the text message just as Vee</p>
<p>hollered my name from the street.</p>
<p>“Yo, babe! Over here!”</p>
<p>I walked to where she was parallel parked at the curb and</p>
<p>folded my arms on the open window frame. “Well? Was it worth</p>
<p>it?”</p>
<p>“Skipping class? Heck, yeah. Rixon and I spent the morning</p>
<p>playing Xbox at his place. Halo Two.” She reached over and</p>
<p>unlatched the passenger door.</p>
<p>“Sounds romantic,” I said, climbing in.</p>
<p>“Don’t knock it till you’ve tried it. Violence really puts guys in</p>
<p>the mood.”</p>
<p>“In the mood? Is there something I should know about?”</p>
<p>Vee flashed a hundred-watt grin. “We kissed. Oh man, it was</p>
<p>good. It started out all slow and gentle, and then Rixon really</p>
<p>started getting into it—”</p>
<p>“Okay!” I cut in loudly. Had I been this sappy when Patch and I</p>
<p>were together and Vee was odd man out? I prayed not. “Where</p>
<p>to now?”</p>
<p>She scooted back into traffic. “I’m tired of studying. I need to</p>
<p>inject a little excitement into my life, and that ain’t gonna happen</p>
<p>with my nose in a book.”</p>
<p>“What did you have in mind?”</p>
<p>“Old Orchard Beach. I’m in the mood for some sun and sand.</p>
<p>Plus, my tan could use a base coat.”</p>
<p>Old Orchard Beach sounded perfect. It had a long pier that</p>
<p>stretched out over the water, an on-the-beach amusement park,</p>
<p>and fireworks and dancing after dark. Unfortunately, the beach</p>
<p>would have to wait.</p>
<p>I jiggled my cell phone. “We already have plans tonight.”</p>
<p>Vee leaned sideways to read the text message and</p>
<p>grimaced. “Marcie’s party reminder? For real? I didn’t realize</p>
<p>you guys were new BFFs.”</p>
<p>“I was told that missing her party is the surest way to</p>
<p>sabotage my social life.”</p>
<p>“She’s such a ho. Missing her party is the surest way to</p>
<p>make my life complete.”</p>
<p>“Might want to rethink your attitude, because I’m going—and</p>
<p>you’re coming with me.”</p>
<p>Vee pressed back against her seat, her arms going rigid on</p>
<p>the steering wheel. “What’s her angle, anyway? Why’d she</p>
<p>invite you?”</p>
<p>“We’re chemistry partners.”</p>
<p>“Seems to me like you’re forgiving her for that black eye</p>
<p>awfully fast.”</p>
<p>“I owe it to her to at least show up for an hour. As her</p>
<p>“I owe it to her to at least show up for an hour. As her</p>
<p>chemistry partner,” I added.</p>
<p>“So you’re saying the reason we’re dragging ourselves to</p>
<p>Marcie’s party tonight is because you sit beside her every</p>
<p>morning in chemistry.” Vee gave me the look of someone who</p>
<p>knows better.</p>
<p>I knew it was a lame excuse, but not as lame as the truth. I</p>
<p>needed to make absolutely certain Patch had moved on to</p>
<p>Marcie. When I’d touched his scars two nights ago and been</p>
<p>transported into his memory, he’d seemed reserved with</p>
<p>Marcie. Up until their kiss, he’d even been short with her. I</p>
<p>hadn’t made up my mind how he felt about her. But if he’d</p>
<p>moved on, it would make it that much easier for me to do</p>
<p>likewise. A confirmed relationship between Patch and Marcie</p>
<p>would make it easy to hate him. And I wanted to hate him. For</p>
<p>both our sakes.</p>
<p>“Your breath smells like liar, liar pants on fire,” Vee said. “This</p>
<p>isn’t about you and Marcie. This is about Patch and Marcie. You</p>
<p>want to find out what’s going on between them.”</p>
<p>I tossed my hands in the air. “Fine! Is that so wrong?”</p>
<p>“Man,” she said, wagging her head, “you really are a glutton</p>
<p>for punishment.”</p>
<p>“I thought maybe we could look in her bedroom. See if we</p>
<p>find anything that proves they’re together.”</p>
<p>“Like used condoms?”</p>
<p>Suddenly my breakfast was rising up my esophagus. I hadn’t</p>
<p>thought of that. Were they sleeping together? No. I didn’t</p>
<p>believe it. Patch wouldn’t do that to me. Not with Marcie.</p>
<p>“I know!” Vee said. “We could steal her diary!”</p>
<p>“The one she’s been carrying around since freshman year?”</p>
<p>“The one she swears would make the National Enquirer</p>
<p>look tame,” she said, sounding strangely gleeful. “If something</p>
<p>is going on between her and Patch, it’ll be in the diary.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Oh, come on. We’ll give it back after we’re done. No harm,</p>
<p>no foul.”</p>
<p>“How? Toss it on her porch and run? She’ll kill us if she finds</p>
<p>out we took it.”</p>
<p>“Sure. Toss it on her porch, or take it during the party, read it</p>
<p>somewhere, and put it back before we leave.”</p>
<p>“It just seems wrong.”</p>
<p>“We won’t tell anyone what we read. It’ll be our secret. It’s not</p>
<p>wrong if nobody gets hurt.”</p>
<p>I wasn’t sold on stealing Marcie’s diary, but I could tell Vee</p>
<p>wasn’t going to let it drop. The most important thing was getting</p>
<p>her to agree to come to the party with me. I wasn’t sure I was</p>
<p>courageous enough to go on my own. Especially since I couldn’t</p>
<p>count on having a single friend there. So I said, “You’ll pick me</p>
<p>up tonight, then?”</p>
<p>“Count on it. Hey, can we light her bedroom on fire before we</p>
<p>leave?”</p>
<p>“No. She can’t know we were snooping in it.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but subtle really isn’t my style.”</p>
<p>I looked sideways, eyebrows peaked. “No kidding?”</p>
<p>It was just after nine when Vee and I climbed the hill leading up</p>
<p>to Marcie’s neighborhood. Coldwater’s socioeconomic map is</p>
<p>easily determined by a simple test: Drop a marble on any street</p>
<p>in town. If the marble rolls downhill, you’re upper class. If the</p>
<p>marble doesn’t roll at all, you’re middle class.And if you lose the</p>
<p>marble in a vapor of fog before you have a chance to find out if</p>
<p>it rolls, you’re … well, you live in my neighborhood. The</p>
<p>backwoods.</p>
<p>Vee pushed the Neon uphill. Marcie’s neighborhood was</p>
<p>older, with mature trees that spilled above the street, blocking</p>
<p>all moonlight. The homes had professionally landscaped yards</p>
<p>and half circles for driveways. The architecture was Georgian</p>
<p>colonial; every house was white with black trim. Vee had the</p>
<p>Neon’s windows rolled down, and in the distance, we heard the</p>
<p>steady pulse of blaring hip-hop.</p>
<p>“What’s her address again?” Vee asked, squinting through</p>
<p>the windshield. “These houses are so far off the road I can’t</p>
<p>read the numbers over the garages.”</p>
<p>“Twelve-twenty Brenchley Street.” We came to an intersection and Vee turned onto Brenchley.</p>
<p>The music intensified as we cruised down the block, and I</p>
<p>assumed it meant we were headed in the right direction. Cars</p>
<p>were parked bumper-to-bumper down both sides of the street.</p>
<p>As we passed an elegantly remodeled carriage house, the</p>
<p>music reached an all-time high, vibrating the car. Flocks of</p>
<p>people were cutting across the lawn, streaming inside the</p>
<p>house. Marcie’s house. One look at it, and I had to wonder why</p>
<p>she shoplifted. For the thrill of it? To escape her parents’</p>
<p>she shoplifted. For the thrill of it? To escape her parents’</p>
<p>carefully and perfectly crafted image?</p>
<p>I didn’t dwell on it longer. A deep ache swirled in my</p>
<p>stomach. Parked in the driveway was Patch’s black Jeep</p>
<p>Commander. Obviously he’d been one of the first to arrive. He’d</p>
<p>probably been inside alone with Marcie hours before the party</p>
<p>started. Doing what, I didn’t want to know. I sucked in a deep</p>
<p>breath and I told myself I could handle this. And wasn’t this the</p>
<p>evidence I’d come looking for?</p>
<p>“What are you thinking?” Vee asked, her gaze also glued to</p>
<p>the Commander as we rolled past.</p>
<p>“That Iwant to throw up.”</p>
<p>“All over Marcie’s foyer would be nice. But seriously. Are you</p>
<p>okay with Patch being here?”</p>
<p>I set my jaw, tilting my chin up slightly. “Marcie invited me</p>
<p>tonight. I have the same right to be here as Patch. I’m not going</p>
<p>to let him dictate where I go and what I do.” Funny, because</p>
<p>that’s exactly what Iwas doing.</p>
<p>Marcie’s front door was open, leading into a dark marble hall</p>
<p>crammed with bodies gyrating to Jay-Z. The foyer merged into</p>
<p>a large sitting room with a high ceiling and dark Victorian</p>
<p>furniture. All of the furniture, including the coffee table, was</p>
<p>being used for seating. Vee hesitated in the doorway.</p>
<p>“Just taking a moment to mentally prepare for this,” she</p>
<p>called to me over the music. “I mean, the place is going to be</p>
<p>infested with Marcie. Marcie portraits, Marcie furniture, Marcie</p>
<p>odors. Speaking of portraits, we should try to find some old</p>
<p>family pictures. I’d like to see what Marcie’s dad looked like ten</p>
<p>years ago. When his dealership commercials come on TV, I</p>
<p>can’t decide if it’s plastic surgery that makes him look so young,</p>
<p>or just massive amounts of makeup.”</p>
<p>I gripped her elbow and yanked her flush against me. “You</p>
<p>are not ditching me now.”</p>
<p>Vee peered inside, frowning. “All right, but I’m warning you, if</p>
<p>I see a single pair of panties, I’m out of here. Same goes for</p>
<p>used condoms.”</p>
<p>I opened my mouth, then snapped it shut. The chances of</p>
<p>seeing both were fairly high, and it was in my best interest not to</p>
<p>officially accept her terms.</p>
<p>I was saved from further discussion by Marcie, who</p>
<p>sashayed out of the darkness holding a punch bowl. She</p>
<p>divided a critical glance between us. “I invited you,” she told me,</p>
<p>“but I didn’t invite her.”</p>
<p>“Good to see you, too,” Vee said.</p>
<p>Marcie scrutinized Vee slowly, head to toe. “Didn’t you used</p>
<p>to be on some stupid color diet? Looks to me like you gave up</p>
<p>before you even started.” She turned her attention to me. “And</p>
<p>you. Nice black eye.”</p>
<p>“Did you hear something, Nora?” Vee asked. “I thought I</p>
<p>heard something.”</p>
<p>“You definitely heard something,” I agreed.</p>
<p>“Could that be … a dog fart I heard?” Vee asked me.</p>
<p>I nodded. “I think so.”</p>
<p>Marcie’s eyes thinned to slits. “Ha, ha.”</p>
<p>“There it went again,” Vee said. “Apparently this dog has real</p>
<p>bad gas. Maybe we should feed it Tums.”</p>
<p>Marcie thrust the punch bowl at us. “Donation. Nobody gets</p>
<p>inside without one.”</p>
<p>“What?” Vee and I said at the same time.</p>
<p>“Do-nay-shun. You didn’t really think I invited you here without</p>
<p>an agenda, did you? I need your cash. Pure and simple.”</p>
<p>Vee and I eyed the bowl, which was swimming with dollar</p>
<p>bills.</p>
<p>“What’s the money for?” I asked.</p>
<p>“New cheerleading uniforms. The squad wants ones with</p>
<p>bare midriffs, but the school’s too cheap to spring for new ones,</p>
<p>so I’m fund-raising.”</p>
<p>“This should be interesting,” Vee said. “The term Slut Squad</p>
<p>will take on a whole new meaning.”</p>
<p>“That does it!” said Marcie, her face darkening with blood.</p>
<p>“You want in? You’d better have a twenty. If you make another</p>
<p>comment, I’ll boost the cover charge to forty.”</p>
<p>Vee poked me in the arm. “I didn’t sign up for this. You pay.”</p>
<p>“Ten each?” I offered.</p>
<p>“No way. This was your idea. You pick up the tab.”</p>
<p>I faced Marcie and pulled on a smile. “Twenty dollars is a lot,”</p>
<p>Ireasoned.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but think how amazing I’ll look in that uniform,” she</p>
<p>said. “I have to do five hundred crunches every night so I can</p>
<p>trim my waist from twenty-five to twenty-four inches before</p>
<p>school starts. I can’t have an inch of fat if I’m going to wear a</p>
<p>bare midriff.”</p>
<p>I didn’t dare pollute my mind with a mental image of Marcie</p>
<p>in a promiscuous cheerleading uniform, and instead said, “How</p>
<p>about fifteen?”</p>
<p>Marcie cupped a hand on her hip and looked ready to slam</p>
<p>the door.</p>
<p>“Okay, calm down, we’ll pay,” said Vee, reaching into her</p>
<p>back pocket. She stuffed a wad of cash into the bowl, but it was</p>
<p>dark and I couldn’t tell how much. “You owe me big-time,” she</p>
<p>told me.</p>
<p>“You’re supposed to let me count the money first,” Marcie</p>
<p>said, digging through the bowl, trying to recapture Vee’s</p>
<p>donation.</p>
<p>“I just assumed twenty was too high for you to count,” Vee</p>
<p>said. “My apologies.”</p>
<p>Marcie’s eyes went slitty again, then she turned on her heel</p>
<p>and carted the bowl back into the house.</p>
<p>“How much did you give her?” I asked Vee.</p>
<p>“I didn’t. I tossed in a condom.”</p>
<p>I lifted my eyebrows. “Since when do you carry condoms?”</p>
<p>“I picked one up off the lawn on our way up the walk. Who</p>
<p>knows, maybe Marcie’ll use it. Then I’ll have done my part to</p>
<p>keep her genetic material out of the gene pool.”</p>
<p>Vee and I stepped all the way inside and put our backs to the</p>
<p>wall. On a velvet chaise in the sitting room, several couples</p>
<p>were tangled together like a pile of paper clips. The center of</p>
<p>the room was filled with dancing bodies. Off the sitting room, an</p>
<p>arched entryway led to the kitchen, where people were drinking</p>
<p>and laughing. Nobody paid Vee or me any attention, and I tried</p>
<p>and laughing. Nobody paid Vee or me any attention, and I tried</p>
<p>to rally my spirits at the realization that getting inside Marcie’s</p>
<p>bedroom unnoticed wasn’t going to be as hard as I’d thought.</p>
<p>Trouble was, I was beginning to think I hadn’t come here tonight</p>
<p>to snoop through Marcie’s bedroom and find evidence that she</p>
<p>was with Patch. In fact, I was dangerously close to thinking I’d</p>
<p>come because I knew Patch would be here. And I wanted to</p>
<p>see him.</p>
<p>It looked like I was going to get my chance. Patch appeared</p>
<p>in the entrance to Marcie’s kitchen, dressed in a black polo shirt</p>
<p>and dark jeans. I wasn’t used to studying him from a distance.</p>
<p>His eyes were the color of night and his hair curling under his</p>
<p>ears looked like it was six weeks past needing a cut. He had a</p>
<p>body that instantly attracted the opposite sex, but his stance</p>
<p>said I’m not open to conversation. His hat was still missing,</p>
<p>which meant it was probably in Marcie’s possession. No big</p>
<p>deal, I reminded myself. It was no longer my business. Patch</p>
<p>could give his ball cap to whoever he wanted. Just because</p>
<p>he’d never loaned it to me didn’t hurt my feelings.</p>
<p>Jenn Martin, a girl I’d had math with freshman year, was</p>
<p>talking to Patch, but he looked distracted. His eyes circled the</p>
<p>sitting room, watchful, as if he wasn’t about to trust a single soul</p>
<p>there. His posture was relaxed but attentive, almost like he</p>
<p>expected something to happen at any moment.</p>
<p>Before his eyes made it around to me, I shifted my gaze.</p>
<p>Best not to be caught staring with regret and longing.</p>
<p>Anthony Amowitz smiled and waved at me from across the</p>
<p>room. I automatically smiled back. We’d had PE together this</p>
<p>year, and while I’d hardly said more than ten words to him, it</p>
<p>was nice to think somebody was excited to see me and Vee</p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>“Why is Anthony Amowitz using his pimp smile on you?” Vee</p>
<p>asked.</p>
<p>Irolled my eyes. “You’re only calling him a pimp because he’s</p>
<p>here.At Marcie’s.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, so?”</p>
<p>“He’s being nice.” I elbowed her. “Smile back.”</p>
<p>“Being nice? He’s being horny.”</p>
<p>Anthony raised his red plastic cup to me and shouted</p>
<p>something, but it was too hard to hear over the music.</p>
<p>“What?” I called back.</p>
<p>“You look great!” A goofy smile was plastered on his face.</p>
<p>“Oh boy,” Vee said. “Not just a pimp, but a smashed pimp.”</p>
<p>“So maybe he’s a little drunk.”</p>
<p>“Drunk and hoping to corner you alone in a bedroom</p>
<p>upstairs.” Ugh.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, we were still holding our position just</p>
<p>inside the front door. I’d had half a can of beer accidentally</p>
<p>sloshed on my shoes, but luckily, there’d been no vomit. I was</p>
<p>about to suggest to Vee that we move away from the open door —the direction everyone seemed to run moments before</p>
<p>spilling the contents of their stomach—when Brenna Dubois</p>
<p>came up and held a red plastic cup out to me.</p>
<p>“This is for you, compliments of the guy across the room.”</p>
<p>“Told you,” Vee whispered sideways.</p>
<p>I stole a quick glance atAnthony, who winked.</p>
<p>“Uh, thanks, but I’m not interested,” I told Brenna. Iwasn’t very</p>
<p>experienced when it came to parties, but I knew not to accept</p>
<p>drinks of questionable origin. For all I knew, it was tainted with</p>
<p>GHB. “Tell Anthony I don’t drink from anything but a sealed can.” Wow. I sounded even dumber than I felt.</p>
<p>“Anthony?” Her face twisted with confusion.</p>
<p>“Yeah, Anthony Pimp-o-witz,” Vee said. “The guy who’s</p>
<p>making you play delivery girl.”</p>
<p>“You thought Anthony gave me the cup?” She shook her</p>
<p>head. “Try the guy on the other side of the room.” She turned to</p>
<p>where Patch had been standing only minutes ago. “Well, he</p>
<p>was over there. I guess he left. He was hot and wearing a black</p>
<p>shirt, if that helps.”</p>
<p>“Oh boy,” Vee said again, this time under her breath.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” I told Brenna, seeing no choice but to take the cup.</p>
<p>She faded back into the crowd, and I set the cup of what</p>
<p>smelled like cherry Coke on the entry table behind me. Was</p>
<p>Patch trying to send a message? Reminding me of my flop of a</p>
<p>fight at the Devil’s Handbag when Marcie had doused me with</p>
<p>cherry Coke?</p>
<p>Vee pushed something into my hand.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” I asked.</p>
<p>“A walkie-talkie. I borrowed them from my brother. I’ll sit on</p>
<p>the stairs and keep watch. If anybody comes up, I’ll radio.”</p>
<p>“You want me to snoop in Marcie’s bedroom now?”</p>
<p>“Iwant you to steal the diary.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, about that. I’m sort of having a change of heart.”</p>
<p>“Are you kidding me?” Vee said. “You can’t chicken out now.</p>
<p>Imagine what’s in that diary. This is your one big chance to find</p>
<p>out what’s going on with Marcie and Patch. You can’t pass that</p>
<p>up.”</p>
<p>“But it’s wrong.”</p>
<p>“It won’t feel wrong if you steal it so fast that the guilt doesn’t</p>
<p>have time to soak in.”</p>
<p>I gave her a pointed look.</p>
<p>“Self-talk helps too,” Vee added. “Tell yourself this isn’t wrong</p>
<p>enough times, and you’ll start to believe it.”</p>
<p>“I’m not taking the diary. I just want to … look around. And</p>
<p>steal Patch’s hat back.”</p>
<p>“I’ll pay you the eZine’s entire annual budget if you deliver the</p>
<p>diary to me in the next thirty minutes,” Vee said, beginning to</p>
<p>sound desperate.</p>
<p>“That’s why you want the diary? To publish it in the eZine?”</p>
<p>“Think about it. It could make my career.”</p>
<p>“No,” I said firmly. “And what’s more, bad Vee.”</p>
<p>She heaved a sigh. “Well, it was worth a try.”</p>
<p>I looked at the walkie-talkie in my hand. “Why can’t we just</p>
<p>text?”</p>
<p>“Spies don’t text.”</p>
<p>“How do you know?”</p>
<p>“How do you know they do?”</p>
<p>Figuring it wasn’t worth an argument, I tucked the walkietalkie</p>
<p>into the waistband of my jeans. “Are you sure Marcie’s</p>
<p>bedroom is on the second floor?”</p>
<p>“One of her ex-boyfriends sits behind me in Spanish. He told</p>
<p>me every night at ten sharp Marcie undresses with the lights on.</p>
<p>Sometimes when he and his friends are bored, they drive over</p>
<p>to watch the show. He said Marcie never rushes, and by the</p>
<p>time she finishes, he has a cramp in his neck from staring up.</p>
<p>He also said there was this one time—”</p>
<p>I clapped my hands over my ears. “Stop!”</p>
<p>“Hey, if my brain has to be polluted with these kind of details,</p>
<p>I figure yours should too. The whole reason I know all this vomitinducing</p>
<p>information is because Iwas trying to help you.”</p>
<p>I flicked my eyes toward the stairs. My stomach seemed to</p>
<p>weigh twice as much as it had three minutes ago. I hadn’t done</p>
<p>anything, and I was already sick with guilt. When had I become</p>
<p>low enough to snoop in Marcie’s bedroom? When had I let</p>
<p>Patch twist and tangle me up this way? “I guess I’m going up,” I</p>
<p>said unconvincingly. “You’ve got my back?”</p>
<p>“Roger that.”</p>
<p>I climbed the stairs. There was a bathroom with tile floors</p>
<p>and crown molding at the top. I moved down the hall to my left,</p>
<p>passing what looked to be a guest bedroom, and an exercise</p>
<p>room equipped with a treadmill and elliptical. I backtracked, this</p>
<p>time taking the hall to the right. The first door was cracked, and I</p>
<p>peeked inside. The room’s color scheme was a frothy pink —pink walls, pink drapes, and a pink duvet with pink throw</p>
<p>pillows. The closet had spewed itself onto the bed, floor, and</p>
<p>other furniture surfaces. Several photographs, blown to poster</p>
<p>size, were tacked to the walls, and all were of Marcie posing</p>
<p>size, were tacked to the walls, and all were of Marcie posing</p>
<p>seductively in her Razorbills cheerleading uniform. I</p>
<p>experienced a mild rush of nausea, then saw Patch’s ball cap</p>
<p>on the dresser. Shutting myself in the room, I rolled the bill of the</p>
<p>cap into a narrow cone and crammed it into my back pocket.</p>
<p>Beneath the ball cap, lying on the dresser, was a single car key.</p>
<p>It was a spare, but it had a Jeep tag. Patch had given Marcie a</p>
<p>spare to his Jeep.</p>
<p>Swiping the key off the dresser, I shoved it deep into my</p>
<p>other back pocket. While Iwas at it, I figured I might as well look</p>
<p>for anything else belonging to him.</p>
<p>I opened and closed a few dresser drawers. I looked under</p>
<p>the bed, in the hope chest, and on the top shelf of Marcie’s</p>
<p>closet. Finally I slipped my hand between the mattress and box</p>
<p>spring. I pulled out the diary. Marcie’s small blue diary, rumored</p>
<p>to contain more scandal than a tabloid. Holding it between my</p>
<p>hands, I felt the overwhelming temptation to open it. What had</p>
<p>she written about Patch? What secret things were hiding in the</p>
<p>pages?</p>
<p>My walkie-talkie crackled.</p>
<p>“Oh, crap,” Vee said through it.</p>
<p>I fumbled it out of my waistband and pushed the talk button.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“Dog. Big dog. It just lumbered into the living room, or</p>
<p>whatever you call this humongous open space. It’s staring at</p>
<p>me. Like, staring right at me.”</p>
<p>“What kind of dog?”</p>
<p>“I’m not up-to-date on my dog species, but I think it’s a</p>
<p>Doberman pinscher. Pointed, snarling face. It resembles</p>
<p>Marcie a little too much, if that helps. Uh-oh. Its ears just went</p>
<p>up. It’s coming toward me. I think it’s one of those psychic dogs.</p>
<p>It knows I’m not just sitting here minding my own business.”</p>
<p>“Stay calm—”</p>
<p>“Shoo, dog, I said shoo!”</p>
<p>The unmistakable growl of a big dog came through the</p>
<p>walkie-talkie.</p>
<p>“Um, Nora? We have a problem,” Vee said a moment later.</p>
<p>“The dog didn’t leave?”</p>
<p>“Worse. It just bounded upstairs.”</p>
<p>Just then there was a snapping bark at the door. The barking</p>
<p>didn’t stop—it grew louder and more snarling.</p>
<p>“Vee!” I hissed into the walkie-talkie. “Get rid of the dog!”</p>
<p>She said something in response, but I couldn’t hear over the</p>
<p>dog’s growls. I flattened my hand to my ear. “What?”</p>
<p>“Marcie’s coming! Get out of there!”</p>
<p>I started to shove the diary back under the mattress, but</p>
<p>fumbled it. Handfuls of notes and pictures spilled from the</p>
<p>pages. In a panic, I raked the notes and pictures into a pile and</p>
<p>tossed them back inside the diary. Then I rammed the diary,</p>
<p>which was quite small considering how many secrets it was</p>
<p>rumored to hold, and my walkie-talkie into the waistband of my</p>
<p>pants and flipped the light switch off. I’d deal with putting the</p>
<p>diary back later. Right now, I had to get out.</p>
<p>I raised the window, expecting to have to remove the screen,</p>
<p>but it was already done for me. Probably Marcie had removed it</p>
<p>long ago to avoid the nuisance when she was sneaking out.</p>
<p>That thought gave me a small measure of hope. If Marcie had</p>
<p>climbed out before, I could too. It wasn’t like I was going to fall</p>
<p>and kill myself. Of course, Marcie was a cheerleader and a lot</p>
<p>more flexible and coordinated.</p>
<p>Poking my head out the open window, I looked down. The</p>
<p>front door was directly below, under a portico supported by four</p>
<p>pillars. Swinging one leg out, I found traction on the shingles.</p>
<p>After I was sure I wasn’t going to slide off the sloped portico, I</p>
<p>brought my other leg out. Balancing my weight, I lowered the</p>
<p>window back in place. I’d just ducked below the window line</p>
<p>when the glass filled with light. The dog’s nails clicked against</p>
<p>the glass, and it uttered a round of furious barks. Dropping to</p>
<p>my stomach, I squeezed as close to the house as I could and</p>
<p>prayed Marcie didn’t open the window and look down.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Marcie’s muffled voice carried through the</p>
<p>window-pane. “What’s the matter, Boomer?”</p>
<p>A trickle of sweat fell down my spine. Marcie was going to</p>
<p>look down, and she was going to see me. I shut my eyes and</p>
<p>tried to forget that her house was filled with people I had to</p>
<p>attend school with for the next two years. How was I going to</p>
<p>explain snooping in Marcie’s bedroom? How was I going to</p>
<p>explain holding her diary? The thought was too humiliating to</p>
<p>bear.</p>
<p>“Shut up, Boomer!” Marcie shouted. “Would somebody hold</p>
<p>my dog while I open the window? If you don’t hold him, he’s</p>
<p>stupid enough to jump out. You—in the hall. Yes, you. Grab my</p>
<p>dog’s collar and don’t let go. Just do it.”</p>
<p>Hoping the dog’s barking would mask any sounds I made, I</p>
<p>rolled over and planted my back against the shingles. I</p>
<p>swallowed the knot of fright in my throat. I had kind of a phobia</p>
<p>about heights, and the thought of all that air between me and the</p>
<p>ground had sweat leaking from my skin.</p>
<p>Digging my heels into the roof to push my weight as far away</p>
<p>from the ledge as possible, Iwrestled the walkie-talkie out of my</p>
<p>pants. “Vee?” Iwhispered.</p>
<p>“Where are you?” she said through the music blaring in the</p>
<p>background.</p>
<p>“Think you could get rid of the dog any day now?”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“Be creative.”</p>
<p>“Like feed it poison?”</p>
<p>I wiped sweat off my forehead with the back of my hand. “I</p>
<p>was thinking more like lock it in a closet.”</p>
<p>“You mean touch it?”</p>
<p>“Vee!”</p>
<p>“Okay, okay, I’ll think of something.”</p>
<p>Thirty seconds ticked by before I heard Vee’s voice float</p>
<p>through Marcie’s bedroom window.</p>
<p>“Hey, Marcie?” she called over the barking. “Not to interfere,</p>
<p>but the police are at the front door. They said they’re responding</p>
<p>to a noise complaint. Do you want me to invite them in?”</p>
<p>“What?” Marcie shrilled directly above me. “I don’t see any</p>
<p>police cars.”</p>
<p>“They probably had to park a couple blocks over. Anyway, as</p>
<p>I was saying, I noticed illegal substances in the hands of a few</p>
<p>guests.”</p>
<p>“So?” she snapped. “It’s a party.”</p>
<p>“Alcohol is illegal under the age of twenty-one.”</p>
<p>“Great!” Marcie shouted. “What am I going to do?” She</p>
<p>paused, then raised her voice again. “You probably called</p>
<p>them!”</p>
<p>“Who, me?” Vee said. “And lose the free food? No way.”</p>
<p>A moment later, Boomer’s frantic barking faded into the</p>
<p>house, and the bedroom light blinked out.</p>
<p>I held perfectly still a moment longer, listening. When I was</p>
<p>positive Marcie’s bedroom was empty, I flipped to my stomach</p>
<p>and belly-crawled up to the window. The dog was gone, Marcie</p>
<p>was gone, and if I could just—</p>
<p>I pressed my palms to the window to force it up, but it didn’t</p>
<p>budge. Leveraging my hands lower on the pane, I put all my</p>
<p>strength into it. Nothing happened.</p>
<p>Okay, I thought. No big deal. Marcie must have locked the</p>
<p>window. All I had to do was hang out here another five hours</p>
<p>until the party ended, then get Vee to come back with a ladder.</p>
<p>I heard footsteps on the walk below and craned my neck to</p>
<p>see if by some stroke of luck Vee had come to my rescue. To</p>
<p>my horror, Patch had his back to me, walking toward the Jeep.</p>
<p>He punched a number into his cell and raised it to his ear. Two</p>
<p>seconds later, my cell phone sang out in my pocket. Before I</p>
<p>could hurl the cell into the bushes at the edge of the property,</p>
<p>Patch came to a stop.</p>
<p>He looked over his shoulder, his eyes traveling up. His gaze</p>
<p>fell on me, and I thought it would have been better if Boomer</p>
<p>had shredded me alive.</p>
<p>“And here I thought they were called Peeping Toms.” I didn’t</p>
<p>need to see him to know he wore a smile.</p>
<p>“Stop laughing,” I said, my cheeks hot with humiliation. “Get</p>
<p>me down.”</p>
<p>“Jump.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I’ll catch you.”</p>
<p>“Are you crazy? Go inside and open the window. Or get a</p>
<p>ladder.”</p>
<p>“I don’t need a ladder. Jump. I’m not going to drop you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, sure! Like I believe that!”</p>
<p>“You want my help or not?”</p>
<p>“You call this help?” I hissed furiously. “This isn’t help!”</p>
<p>He spun his key chain around his finger, then started to walk</p>
<p>away.</p>
<p>“You are such a jerk! Get back here!”</p>
<p>“Jerk?” he repeated. “You’re the one spying in windows.”</p>
<p>“Iwasn’t spying. Iwas—Iwas—” Think of something!</p>
<p>Patch’s eyes flicked to the window above me, and I watched</p>
<p>as understanding dawned on his face. He tilted his head back</p>
<p>and gave a bark of laughter. “You were searching Marcie’s</p>
<p>bedroom.”</p>
<p>“No.” Irolled my eyes like it was the most absurd suggestion.</p>
<p>“What were you looking for?”</p>
<p>“Nothing.” I yanked Patch’s ball cap out of my back pocket</p>
<p>and flung it at him. “And here’s your stupid hat back, by the way!</p>
<p>”</p>
<p>“You went in for my hat?”</p>
<p>“A big waste, obviously!”</p>
<p>He fit the hat to his head. “Are you going to jump?”</p>
<p>I took an uneasy look over the edge of the portico, and the</p>
<p>ground seemed to drop another twenty feet out of reach.</p>
<p>Sidestepping an answer, I asked, “Why did you call?”</p>
<p>“I lost sight of you inside. I wanted to make sure you were</p>
<p>okay.”</p>
<p>He sounded sincere, but he was a smooth liar. “And the</p>
<p>cherry Coke?”</p>
<p>“Peace offering. You going to jump or what?”</p>
<p>Seeing no alternative, I scooted cautiously to the edge of the</p>
<p>portico. My stomach flipped circles. “If you drop me …,” I</p>
<p>warned.</p>
<p>Patch had his arms raised. Squeezing my eyes shut, I slid off</p>
<p>the ledge. I felt air break around my body and then I was in</p>
<p>Patch’s arms, anchored against him. I stayed there a moment,</p>
<p>heart hammering from both the adrenaline of falling and from</p>
<p>standing so close to Patch. He felt warm and familiar. He felt</p>
<p>solid and safe. I wanted to cling to his shirt, bury my face into</p>
<p>the warm curve of his neck, and never let go.</p>
<p>Patch tucked a stray curl behind my ear. “Do you want to go</p>
<p>back to the party?” he murmured.</p>
<p>I shook my head no.</p>
<p>I shook my head no.</p>
<p>“I’ll drive you home.” He used his chin to gesture at the Jeep,</p>
<p>because he still hadn’t unfolded his arms from around me.</p>
<p>“I came with Vee,” I said. “I should catch a ride with her.”</p>
<p>“Vee’s not going to pick up Chinese takeout on the way</p>
<p>home.”</p>
<p>Chinese takeout. That would involve Patch coming inside the</p>
<p>farmhouse to eat. My mom wasn’t home, which meant we would</p>
<p>be all alone….</p>
<p>I let my guard slide a little further. Probably we were safe.</p>
<p>Probably the archangels were nowhere close. Patch didn’t</p>
<p>seem worried, so neither should I. And it was just dinner. I’d had</p>
<p>a long, unsatisfying day at school, and I was famished from an</p>
<p>hour at the gym. Takeout with Patch sounded perfect. How was</p>
<p>a casual dinner together going to hurt? People ate dinner</p>
<p>together all the time and never carried it further. “Just dinner,” I</p>
<p>said, more to convince myself than Patch.</p>
<p>He gave the Boy Scout salute, but his smile was up to no</p>
<p>good. A bad boy’s smile. The wicked, charming smile of a guy</p>
<p>who’d kissed Marcie a mere two nights ago … and was</p>
<p>offering to have dinner with me tonight, most likely with the hope</p>
<p>that dinner would lead to something else entirely. He thought</p>
<p>one heart-melting smile was all it would take to erase my hurt.</p>
<p>To make me forget he’d kissed Marcie.</p>
<p>All my inner turmoil scattered as I was jerked to the present.</p>
<p>My speculations died, replaced by a sudden, strong feeling of</p>
<p>unease that had nothing to do with Patch, or Sunday night.</p>
<p>Goose bumps prickled my skin. I studied the shadows ringing</p>
<p>the lawn.</p>
<p>“Mmm?” Patch murmured, detecting my concern, tightening</p>
<p>his arms protectively around me.</p>
<p>And then I felt it again. A change in the air. An invisible fog,</p>
<p>strangely warm, hanging low, pressing all around, zigzagging</p>
<p>closer like a hundred stealthy snakes in the air. The sensation</p>
<p>was so disruptive, I had a hard time believing Patch hadn’t at</p>
<p>least noticed something was off, even if he couldn’t feel it</p>
<p>directly.</p>
<p>“What is it,Angel?” His voice was low, questioning.</p>
<p>“Are we safe?”</p>
<p>“Does it matter?”</p>
<p>I shifted my eyes around the yard. Iwasn’t sure why, but I kept</p>
<p>thinking, The archangels. They’re here. “I mean … the</p>
<p>archangels,” I said, so quietly I barely heard my own voice.</p>
<p>“Aren’t they watching?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>I tried to step back, but Patch refused to let me. “I don’t care</p>
<p>what they see. I’m tired of the charade.” He’d stopped nuzzling</p>
<p>my neck, and I saw a certain tormented defiance in his eyes.</p>
<p>I struggled harder to pull away. “Let go.”</p>
<p>“You don’t want me?” His smile was all fox.</p>
<p>“That’s not the issue. I don’t want to be responsible for</p>
<p>anything happening to you. Let go.” How could he be so casual</p>
<p>about this? They were hunting for an excuse to get rid of him.</p>
<p>He couldn’t be seen holding me.</p>
<p>He caressed the sides of my arms, but as I tried to take the</p>
<p>opportunity to break away, he caught my hands. His voice broke</p>
<p>into my mind. I could go rogue. I could walk away right now,</p>
<p>and we could stop playing by the archangels’rules. He said it</p>
<p>so decidedly, so easily, I knew this wasn’t the first time he’d</p>
<p>thought it. This was a plan he’d secretly fantasized about many,</p>
<p>many times.</p>
<p>My heart was beating wildly. Walk away? Stop playing by the</p>
<p>rules? “What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>I’d live on the move, constantly hiding, hoping the</p>
<p>archangels don’t find me.</p>
<p>“If they did?”</p>
<p>I’d go to trial. I’d be found guilty, but it would give us a few</p>
<p>weeks alone, while they deliberated.</p>
<p>I could feel the stricken look on my face. “And then?”</p>
<p>They’d send me to hell. He paused, then added with quiet</p>
<p>conviction, I’m not afraid of hell. I deserve what’s coming. I’ve</p>
<p>lied, cheated, deceived. I’ve hurt innocent people. I’ve made</p>
<p>more mistakes than I can remember. One way or another, I’ve</p>
<p>been paying for them most of my existence. Hell won’t be any</p>
<p>different. His mouth quirked into a brief, wry smile. But I’m sure</p>
<p>the archangels have a few cards up their sleeves. His smile</p>
<p>faded, and he looked at me with stripped honesty. Being with</p>
<p>you never felt wrong. It’s the one thing I did right. You’re the</p>
<p>one thing I did right. I don’t care about the archangels. Tell me</p>
<p>what you want me to do. Say the word. I’ll do whatever you</p>
<p>want. We can leave right now.</p>
<p>It took a moment for his words to settle in. I looked to the</p>
<p>Jeep. The wall of ice between us fell away. The wall was only</p>
<p>there because of the archangels. Without them, everything</p>
<p>Patch and I had been fighting over meant nothing. They were</p>
<p>the problem. I wanted to leave them, and everything else,</p>
<p>behind and race off with Patch. Iwanted to be reckless; thinking</p>
<p>only of right here, right now. We could make each other forget</p>
<p>about consequences. We’d laugh at rules, boundaries, and</p>
<p>most of all, tomorrow. There would only be me and Patch, and</p>
<p>nothing else would matter.</p>
<p>Nothing but the promise of what would happen when those</p>
<p>weeks drew to a close.</p>
<p>I had two choices, but the answer was clear. The only way I</p>
<p>could keep Patch was by letting him go. By having nothing to do</p>
<p>with him.</p>
<p>I didn’t realize I was crying until Patch ran his thumbs under</p>
<p>my eyes. “Shh,” he murmured. “It’s going to be okay. Iwant you. I</p>
<p>can’t keep doing what I’m doing now, living halfway.”</p>
<p>“But they’ll send you to hell,” I stammered, unable to control</p>
<p>the quiver in my lower lip.</p>
<p>“I’ve had a long time to come to terms with it.”</p>
<p>I was determined not to show Patch how hard this was for</p>
<p>me, but I choked on the tears running down my throat. My eyes</p>
<p>were damp and swollen, and my chest ached. This was all my</p>
<p>fault. If it weren’t for me, he wouldn’t be a guardian angel. If it</p>
<p>weren’t for me, the archangels wouldn’t be bent on destroying</p>
<p>him. I was responsible for driving him to this point.</p>
<p>“I need one favor,” I finally said in a small voice that sounded</p>
<p>more like a stranger’s than my own. “Tell Vee I walked home. I</p>
<p>need to be alone.”</p>
<p>“Angel?” Patch reached for my hand, but I pulled free. I felt</p>
<p>my feet walking away, one step in front of the other. Farther and</p>
<p>farther from Patch they took me, as if my mind had gone numb</p>
<p>and turned all action over to my body.</p><p>

<p></p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>THE FOLLOWING AFTERNOON VEE DROPPED ME OFF near the front</p>
<p>door to Enzo’s. I was dressed in a yellow printed sundress that</p>
<p>walked the line between flirty and professional and was far</p>
<p>more optimistic than anything I felt on the inside. I stopped in</p>
<p>front of the windows to shake out my hair, which had relaxed</p>
<p>into waves after being slept on all night, but the gesture felt</p>
<p>wooden. I forced a smile. It was the one I’d been practicing all</p>
<p>morning. It felt tight at the edges and brittle everywhere in</p>
<p>between. In the window, it looked false and hollow. But for a</p>
<p>morning following a night spent crying, it was the best I could</p>
<p>manage.</p>
<p>After walking home from Marcie’s last night, I’d curled into</p>
<p>bed, but I hadn’t slept. I’d spent the night tormented by selfdestructive</p>
<p>thoughts. The longer I stayed awake, the more my</p>
<p>thoughts took a dizzying departure from reality. I wanted to</p>
<p>make a statement, and I was hurting enough not to care how</p>
<p>drastic it was. A thought came to me, the kind of thought I never</p>
<p>would have entertained in my life before. If I ended my life, the</p>
<p>archangels would see it. I wanted them to feel remorse. I</p>
<p>wanted them to doubt their archaic laws. I wanted them to be</p>
<p>held accountable for ripping my life apart, then ripping it away</p>
<p>completely.</p>
<p>My mind swirled and tottered with these kinds of thoughts all</p>
<p>night. My emotions shifted through heartbreaking loss, denial,</p>
<p>anger. At one point, I regretted not running away with Patch. Any</p>
<p>happiness, no matter how brief, seemed better than the long,</p>
<p>simmering torture of waking up day after day, knowing I could</p>
<p>never have him.</p>
<p>But as the sun began to crack across the sky this morning, I</p>
<p>came to a decision. I had to move on. It was either that, or slip</p>
<p>into a frozen depression. I forced myself through the motions of</p>
<p>showering and dressing, and went to school with fixed</p>
<p>determination that no one would see below skin-deep. A pinsand-needles</p>
<p>sensation enveloped my body, but I refused to</p>
<p>display a single outward sign of self-pity. Iwasn’t going to let the</p>
<p>archangels win. Iwas going to pull myself back on my feet, get a</p>
<p>job, pay off my speeding ticket, finish summer school with the</p>
<p>top grade, and keep myself so occupied that only at night, when</p>
<p>I was alone with my thoughts and it couldn’t be helped, would I</p>
<p>think of Patch.</p>
<p>Inside Enzo’s, two semicircular balconies spread out to my</p>
<p>left and right, with a set of wide stairs leading down into the</p>
<p>main eating area and front counter. The balconies reminded me</p>
<p>of curved catwalks overlooking a pit. The tables on the balcony</p>
<p>were filled, but only a few stragglers drinking coffee and reading</p>
<p>the morning paper remained in the pit. With the help of a deep breath, I took the stairs down and</p>
<p>approached the front counter.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, I heard you’re hiring baristas,” I told the woman</p>
<p>at the register. My voice sounded flat in my ears, but I didn’t</p>
<p>have the energy to try to correct it. The woman, a middle-aged</p>
<p>redhead with a name tag that read ROBERTA, looked up. “I’d</p>
<p>like to fill out an application.” I managed a half smile, but</p>
<p>somehow, I feared it wasn’t anywhere close to believable.</p>
<p>Roberta wiped her freckled hands on a rag and came</p>
<p>around the counter. “Baristas? Not anymore.”</p>
<p>I stared at her, holding my breath, feeling all hope deflate</p>
<p>inside me. My plan was everything. I hadn’t considered what I</p>
<p>would do if even one step of it was yanked out from under me. I</p>
<p>needed a plan. I needed this job. I needed a carefully controlled</p>
<p>life where every minute was planned, and every emotion</p>
<p>compartmentalized.</p>
<p>“But I’m still looking for a reliable counter attendant, night shift</p>
<p>only, six to ten,” Roberta added.</p>
<p>I blinked, my lip quivering slightly in surprise. “Oh,” I said.</p>
<p>“That’s … good.”</p>
<p>“At night we dim the lights, bring out the baristas, play a little</p>
<p>jazz, and try for a more sophisticated feel. It used to be dead in</p>
<p>here after five, but we’re hoping to lure crowds. Tough</p>
<p>economy,” she explained. “You’d be in charge of greeting</p>
<p>customers and writing down orders, then calling them in to the</p>
<p>kitchen. When the food’s ready, you’d carry it out to the tables.”</p>
<p>I tried to nod eagerly, determined to show her how much I</p>
<p>wanted this job, feeling all the tiny cracks in my lips split as I</p>
<p>smiled. “That—sounds perfect,” Imanaged in a husky voice.</p>
<p>“Do you have any work experience?”</p>
<p>I didn’t. But Vee and I came to Enzo’s at least three times a</p>
<p>week. “I know the menu by heart,” I said, beginning to feel more</p>
<p>solid, more real. A job. Everything depended on it. I was going</p>
<p>to build a new life.</p>
<p>“That’s what I like to hear,” Roberta said. “When can you</p>
<p>start?”</p>
<p>“Tonight?” I could hardly believe she was offering me the job.</p>
<p>Here I was, unable to summon up even a sincere smile, but she</p>
<p>was overlooking it. She was giving me a chance. I put my hand</p>
<p>forward to shake hers, then noticed a half beat too late that it</p>
<p>was trembling.</p>
<p>She ignored my outstretched hand, eying me with her head</p>
<p>cocked to one side in a way that only made me feel more</p>
<p>exposed and self-conscious. “Is everything okay?”</p>
<p>I sucked in a silent breath and held it. “Yes—I’m fine.”</p>
<p>She gave a brisk nod. “Get here at a quarter to six and I’ll</p>
<p>issue you a uniform before your shift.”</p>
<p>“Thank you so much—,” I began, my voice still in shock, but</p>
<p>she was already scooting back behind the counter.</p>
<p>As I stepped outside to a blinding sun, I ran calculations in</p>
<p>my head. Assuming I was going to make minimum wage, if I</p>
<p>worked every night for the next two weeks, I just might be able</p>
<p>to pay off my speeding ticket. And if Iworked every night for two</p>
<p>months, that was sixty nights that I’d be too drowned in work to</p>
<p>dwell on Patch. Sixty nights closer to the end of summer</p>
<p>vacation, when I could once again throw all my energy into</p>
<p>school. I’d already decided to pack my schedule with</p>
<p>school. I’d already decided to pack my schedule with</p>
<p>demanding classes. I could handle homework in every shape</p>
<p>and form, but heartbreak was entirely different.</p>
<p>“Well?” Vee asked, coasting up beside me in the Neon.</p>
<p>“How’d it go?”</p>
<p>I climbed into the passenger seat. “I got the job.”</p>
<p>“Nice. You seemed really nervous going in, almost like you</p>
<p>were going to lose it, but no reason to worry now. You’re</p>
<p>officially a hard-working member of society. Proud of you, babe. When do you start?”</p>
<p>I checked the readout on the dash. “Four hours.”</p>
<p>“I’ll stop by tonight and request to be seated in your area.”</p>
<p>“Better leave a tip,” I said, my attempt at humor nearly</p>
<p>bringing me to tears.</p>
<p>“I’m your chauffeur. That’s better than a tip.”</p>
<p>Six and a half hours later, Enzo’s was jammed to the walls. My</p>
<p>work uniform consisted of a white pintuck shirt, gray tweed</p>
<p>slacks with a matching vest, and a newsboy cap. The newsboy</p>
<p>cap wasn’t doing a very good job of holding up my hair, which</p>
<p>refused to stay tucked out of sight. At this moment, I could feel</p>
<p>stray curls plastered to the sides of my face with sweat. Despite</p>
<p>the fact that I was completely overwhelmed, it felt strangely</p>
<p>relieving to be in over my head. There was no time to shift my</p>
<p>thoughts, even fleetingly, to Patch.</p>
<p>“New girl!” One of the cooks—Fernando—was shouting at</p>
<p>me. He stood behind a short wall that separated the ovens from</p>
<p>the rest of the kitchen, flapping a spatula. “Your order is up!”</p>
<p>I grabbed the three sandwich plates, carefully stacked them</p>
<p>up my arm in a row, and backed out of the swinging doors. On</p>
<p>my way across the pit, I caught the eye of one of the hostesses.</p>
<p>She jerked her chin at a newly seated table up on the balcony. I</p>
<p>answered with a quick nod. Be there in a minute.</p>
<p>“One prime rib sandwich, one salami, and one roasted</p>
<p>turkey,” I said, setting the plates down in front of a party of three</p>
<p>businessmen in suits. “Enjoy your meal.”</p>
<p>I jogged up the steps leading out of the pit, pulling my meal</p>
<p>order pad out of my back pocket. Halfway down the catwalk, my</p>
<p>stride caught. Marcie Millar was directly ahead, seated at my</p>
<p>newest table. I also recognized Addyson Hales, Oakley</p>
<p>Williams, and Ethan Tyler, all from school. I thought about</p>
<p>making an about-face and telling the hostess to give someone</p>
<p>else—anyone else—my table, when Marcie glanced up and I</p>
<p>knew Iwas trapped.</p>
<p>A granite-hard smile touched her mouth.</p>
<p>My breathing faltered. Was there any possible way she could</p>
<p>know I’d taken her diary? It wasn’t until I’d walked home and</p>
<p>crawled into bed last night that I remembered I still had it. I</p>
<p>would have returned it right then, but it had been the last thing</p>
<p>on my mind. The diary had seemed insignificant next to the raw</p>
<p>turmoil scraping me both inside and out. As of this moment, it</p>
<p>was sitting untouched on my bedroom floor, right beside last</p>
<p>night’s discarded clothes.</p>
<p>“Isn’t your outfit the cutest thing ever?” Marcie said over the</p>
<p>prerecorded jazz. “Ethan, didn’t you wear a vest just like that to</p>
<p>prom last year? I think Nora raided your closet.” While they laughed, I held my pen poised on the order pad.</p>
<p>“Can I get you something to drink? The special tonight is our</p>
<p>coconut lime smoothie.” Could everyone hear the scratch of</p>
<p>guilt in my voice? I swallowed, hoping that when I spoke again,</p>
<p>the jittery quality would be gone.</p>
<p>“Last time I was in here, it was my mom’s birthday,” Marcie</p>
<p>said. “Our waitress sang ‘Happy Birthday’ to her.”</p>
<p>It took me a whole three seconds to catch on. “Oh. No. I</p>
<p>mean— no. I’m not a waitress. I’m a counter attendant.”</p>
<p>“I don’t care what you are. Iwant you to sing ‘Happy Birthday’</p>
<p>to me.”</p>
<p>I stood paralyzed, my mind frantically groping for an escape. I</p>
<p>couldn’t believe Marcie was asking me to humiliate myself this</p>
<p>way. Wait. Of course she was asking me to humiliate myself.</p>
<p>For the past eleven years, I’d kept a secret scorecard between</p>
<p>us, but now I was certain she was keeping her own scorecard.</p>
<p>She lived for the chance to one-up me. Worse, she knew her</p>
<p>score doubled mine and she was still running up the points. Which made her not only a bully, but a bad sport.</p>
<p>I held out my hand. “Let me see your ID.”</p>
<p>Marcie lifted an uncaring shoulder. “I forgot it.” We both knew she hadn’t forgotten her driver’s license, and</p>
<p>we both knew it wasn’t her birthday.</p>
<p>“We’re really busy tonight,” I said, feigning apology. “My</p>
<p>manager wouldn’t want me to take time away from the other</p>
<p>customers.”</p>
<p>“Your manager would want you to keep your customers</p>
<p>happy. Now sing.”</p>
<p>“And while you’re at it,” Ethan chimed in, “bring out one of</p>
<p>those free chocolate cakes.”</p>
<p>“We’re only supposed to give out one slice, not a whole</p>
<p>cake,” I said.</p>
<p>“We’re only supposed to give out one slice,” Addyson</p>
<p>mimicked, and the table erupted with laughter.</p>
<p>Marcie reached into her handbag and pulled out a Flip</p>
<p>camera. The red power button blinked on, and she aimed the</p>
<p>lens at me. “I can’t wait to spam this video to the entire school.</p>
<p>Good thing I have access to everyone’s e-mail. Who would’ve</p>
<p>thought being an office aide would be so useful?”</p>
<p>She knew about the diary. She had to.And this was payback.</p>
<p>Fifty points to me for stealing her diary. Twice that many to her</p>
<p>for sending a video of me singing “Happy Birthday, Marcie” to</p>
<p>all of Coldwater High.</p>
<p>I pointed over my shoulder at the kitchen and slowly backed</p>
<p>up. “Listen, my orders are piling up—”</p>
<p>“Ethan, go tell that lovely hostess over there that we demand</p>
<p>to speak to the manager. Tell her our counter attendant is being</p>
<p>cranky,” Marcie said.</p>
<p>I couldn’t believe it. Less than three hours on the job, and</p>
<p>Marcie was going to get me fired. How was I going to pay off</p>
<p>my ticket? And good-bye, Volkswagen Cabriolet. Most</p>
<p>importantly, I needed the job to distract myself from the useless</p>
<p>struggle of finding a way to deal with the blistering truth: Patch</p>
<p>was out of my life. For good.</p>
<p>“Time’s up,” Marcie said. “Ethan, ask for the manager.”</p>
<p>“Wait,” I said. “I’ll do it.”</p>
<p>Marcie squealed and clapped her hands. “Good thing I</p>
<p>charged my battery.”</p>
<p>Subconsciously, I tugged the newsboy cap lower, shielding</p>
<p>my face. I opened my mouth. “Happy birthday to you—”</p>
<p>“Louder!” they all shouted.</p>
<p>“Happy birthday to you,” I sang louder, too embarrassed to</p>
<p>tell if my tone was perilously flat. “Happy birthday, dear Marcie.</p>
<p>Happy birthday to you.”</p>
<p>Nobody said a word. Marcie stowed the Flip back inside her</p>
<p>handbag. “Well, that was boring.”</p>
<p>“That sounded … normal,” Ethan said.</p>
<p>Some of the blood drained from my face. I gave a brief,</p>
<p>flustered, triumphant smile. Five hundred points. My solo was</p>
<p>worth at least that. So much for Marcie blowing me to</p>
<p>smithereens. I had officially taken the lead. “Drinks, anyone?” I</p>
<p>asked, sounding surprisingly cheerful.</p>
<p>After scribbling down their orders, I turned to head back to</p>
<p>the kitchen, when Marcie called out, “Oh, and Nora?”</p>
<p>I stopped in my tracks. I sucked in a sharp breath, wondering</p>
<p>what hoops she thought she could make me jump through next.</p>
<p>Oh, no. Unless … she was going to out me. Right now. In front of</p>
<p>all these people. She was going to tell the world I stole her diary,</p>
<p>so they could see just how low and despicable Ireally was.</p>
<p>“Could you rush our order?” Marcie finished. “We have a</p>
<p>party to get to.”</p>
<p>party to get to.”</p>
<p>“Rush your order?” I repeated stupidly. Did this mean she</p>
<p>didn’t know about the diary?</p>
<p>“Patch is meeting us at Delphic Beach, and I don’t want to be</p>
<p>late.” Marcie instantly covered her mouth. “I’m so sorry. I wasn’t</p>
<p>even thinking. I shouldn’t have mentioned Patch. It’s got to be</p>
<p>hard seeing him with someone else.”</p>
<p>Any smile I was clinging to slipped. I felt heat creep up my</p>
<p>neck. My heart beat so fast it made my head light. The room</p>
<p>slanted inward, and Marcie’s cutthroat smile was at the center</p>
<p>of everything, laughing at me. So everything was back to</p>
<p>normal, then. Patch had gone back to Marcie. After I’d walked</p>
<p>away last night, he’d resigned himself to the deal fate had</p>
<p>handed us. If he couldn’t have me, he’d settle for Marcie. How</p>
<p>come they were allowed to have a relationship? Where were</p>
<p>the archangels when it came to keeping tabs on Patch and</p>
<p>Marcie? What about their kiss? Were the archangels going to</p>
<p>let it slide because they knew it meant nothing to either of</p>
<p>them? I wanted to scream at the unfairness of it all. Marcie</p>
<p>could be with Patch when she didn’t love him, but I couldn’t,</p>
<p>because I did and the archangels knew it. Why was it so wrong</p>
<p>for us to be in love? Were angels and humans really that</p>
<p>different?</p>
<p>“It’s fine, I’ve moved on,” I said, injecting a note of cool civility</p>
<p>into my tone.</p>
<p>“Good for you,” Marcie said, nibbling seductively on her</p>
<p>straw, not one part of her looking like she believed me.</p>
<p>Back in the kitchen, I sent Marcie’s table’s order in to the</p>
<p>cooks. I left the “special cooking instructions” space blank.</p>
<p>Marcie was in a hurry to see Patch at Delphic Beach? Too bad.</p>
<p>I picked up my waiting order and carried the tray out of the</p>
<p>kitchen. To my surprise, I saw Scott standing near the front</p>
<p>doors, talking to the hostesses. He was dressed comfortably in</p>
<p>loose-fitting Levi’s and a snug T-shirt, and given the body</p>
<p>language of the two black-clad hostesses, they were flirting with</p>
<p>him. He caught my eye and gave a low wave of recognition. I</p>
<p>dropped off table fifteen’s order, then hiked the stairs.</p>
<p>“Hey,” I told Scott, pulling off the newsboy cap to fan my face.</p>
<p>“Vee told me I’d find you here.”</p>
<p>“You called Vee?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, after you didn’t return any of my messages.”</p>
<p>I wiped my arm across my forehead, sweeping a few loose</p>
<p>hairs back into place. “My cell is in the back. I haven’t had a</p>
<p>chance to check it since I clocked in. What do you need?”</p>
<p>“What time are you off?”</p>
<p>“Ten. Why?”</p>
<p>“There’s a party at Delphic Beach. I’m looking for some poor</p>
<p>sucker to drag along.”</p>
<p>“Every time we hang out, something bad happens.” The light</p>
<p>didn’t go on in his eyes. “The fight at the Z,” I reminded him. “At</p>
<p>the Devil’s Handbag. Both times I had to scrounge a ride home.</p>
<p>”</p>
<p>“Third time’s a charm.” He smiled, and I realized for the first</p>
<p>time that it was a very nice smile. Boyish even. It softened his</p>
<p>personality, making me wonder if there was another side to him,</p>
<p>a side I hadn’t seen yet.</p>
<p>a side I hadn’t seen yet.</p>
<p>Chances were, this was the same party Marcie was headed</p>
<p>to. The same party Patch was supposed to be at.And the same</p>
<p>beach I’d been at with him just a week and a half ago, when I’d</p>
<p>spoken too early by declaring Iwas living the perfect life. I never</p>
<p>could have guessed how fast it would tailspin.</p>
<p>I did a quick inventory of my feelings, but I needed more than</p>
<p>a handful of seconds to figure out how I was feeling. I wanted to</p>
<p>see Patch—I would always want to—but that wasn’t the</p>
<p>question. I needed to determine if Iwas up to seeing him. Could</p>
<p>I handle seeing him with Marcie? Especially after everything</p>
<p>he’d told me last night?</p>
<p>“I’ll think about it,” I told Scott, realizing I was taking too long</p>
<p>to answer.</p>
<p>“Need me to swing by at ten and pick you up?”</p>
<p>“No. If I go, Vee can give me a ride.” I pointed toward the</p>
<p>kitchen doors. “Listen, I need to get back to work.”</p>
<p>“Hope to see you,” he said, shooting me one final grin before</p>
<p>departing.</p>
<p>At closing, I found Vee idling in the parking lot. “Thanks for</p>
<p>the pickup,” I told her, dropping into shotgun. My legs ached</p>
<p>from all the standing, and my ears still rang with the</p>
<p>conversation and loud laughter of a packed restaurant—not to</p>
<p>mention all the times the cooks and waitresses had shouted</p>
<p>corrections at me. I’d carried out at least two wrong orders, and</p>
<p>more than once, I’d entered the kitchen through the wrong door.</p>
<p>Both times, I’d nearly knocked over a waitress up to her arms in</p>
<p>plates. The good news was, I had thirty dollars in tips folded</p>
<p>inside my pocket. After I’d paid off my ticket, all my tips would</p>
<p>go toward the Cabriolet. I longed for the day when I wouldn’t</p>
<p>have to rely on Vee to haul me around.</p>
<p>But not quite as much as I longed for the day when I’d have</p>
<p>forgotten Patch.</p>
<p>Vee grinned. “This ain’t no free service. All these rides are</p>
<p>actually IOUs that will come back to haunt you.”</p>
<p>“I’m serious, Vee. You’re the best friend in the whole world.</p>
<p>The bestest.”</p>
<p>“Aw, maybe we should commemorate this Hallmark moment</p>
<p>and swing by Skippy’s for ice cream. I could use some ice</p>
<p>cream. Actually, I could really use some MSG. Nothing makes</p>
<p>me happy quite like a boatload of freshly fried fast food,</p>
<p>smothered in good old-fashioned MSG.”</p>
<p>“Rain check?” I asked. “I got invited to hang out at Delphic</p>
<p>Beach tonight. You’re more than welcome to come,” I added</p>
<p>quickly. I wasn’t at all sure I’d made the best decision when I’d</p>
<p>made up my mind to go tonight. Why was I putting myself</p>
<p>through the torture of seeing Patch again? I knew it was</p>
<p>because I wanted him close, even if close wasn’t close enough.</p>
<p>A stronger, braver person would cut all ties and walk away. A</p>
<p>stronger person wouldn’t beat her fists against fate’s door.</p>
<p>Patch was out of my life for good. I knew I needed to accept it,</p>
<p>but there was a big difference between knowing and doing.</p>
<p>“Who all’s going?” Vee asked.</p>
<p>“Scott and a few other people from school.” No need to</p>
<p>mention Marcie and get an instant veto. I had a feeling I could</p>
<p>use Vee’s support tonight.</p>
<p>use Vee’s support tonight.</p>
<p>“Think I’ll curl up with Rixon and watch a movie instead. I can</p>
<p>ask if he’s got any other friends he can hook you up with. We</p>
<p>could do a double-date thing. Eat popcorn, tell jokes, make out.</p>
<p>”</p>
<p>“Pass.” I didn’t want someone else. Iwanted Patch.</p>
<p>By the time Vee rolled into Delphic Beach’s parking lot, the sky</p>
<p>was tar black. High-power lights that reminded me of those on</p>
<p>CHS’s football field beamed down on the whitewashed wood</p>
<p>structures housing the carousel, arcade, and mini golf, causing</p>
<p>a halo to hover over the spot. There was no electricity farther</p>
<p>down the beach, or in the surrounding fields, making it the one</p>
<p>bright spot on the coast for miles. By this time of night I didn’t</p>
<p>expect to find anyone buying hamburgers or playing air hockey,</p>
<p>and I signaled for Vee to pull over near the path of railroad ties</p>
<p>cutting down to the water.</p>
<p>I swung out of the car and mouthed a good-bye. Vee waved</p>
<p>in response, her cell pressed to her ear as she and Rixon</p>
<p>worked out the details of where they’d meet up.</p>
<p>The air still held the earlier heat of the sun and was filled with</p>
<p>the sounds of everything from the distant music carrying down</p>
<p>from Delphic Seaport Amusement Park high on the cliffs, to surf</p>
<p>drumming the sand. I parted the ridge of sea grass that ran</p>
<p>parallel to the coast like a fence, jogged down the slope, and</p>
<p>walked the thin ribbon of dry sand that was just out of reach of</p>
<p>high tide.</p>
<p>I passed small groups of people still playing in the water,</p>
<p>jumping waves and hurling driftwood into the darkness of the</p>
<p>ocean, even though the lifeguards were long gone. I kept my</p>
<p>eyes out for Patch, Scott, Marcie, or anyone else I recognized.</p>
<p>Up ahead, the orange flames of a bonfire winked and flitted in</p>
<p>the darkness. I pulled out my cell and dialed Scott.</p>
<p>“Yo.”</p>
<p>“Imade it,” I said. “Where are you?”</p>
<p>“Just south of the bonfire. You?”</p>
<p>“Just north of it.”</p>
<p>“I’ll find you.”</p>
<p>Two minutes later, Scott plopped down in the sand beside</p>
<p>me. “You going to hang out on the fringe all night?” he asked</p>
<p>me. His breath held the tang of alcohol.</p>
<p>“I’m not a big fan of ninety percent of the people at this party.”</p>
<p>He nodded, understanding, and held out a steel thermos. “I</p>
<p>don’t have germs, scout’s honor. Have as much as you like.”</p>
<p>I leaned over just far enough to smell the contents of the</p>
<p>thermos. Immediately I drew back, feeling fumes burn down the</p>
<p>back of my throat. “What is it?” I choked. “Motor oil?”</p>
<p>“My secret recipe. If I told you, I’d have to kill you.”</p>
<p>“No need. I’m pretty sure taking a drink would get the same</p>
<p>result.”</p>
<p>Scott eased back, elbows in the sand. He’d changed into a</p>
<p>Metallica T-shirt with the sleeves ripped off, khaki shorts, and</p>
<p>flip-flops. I was wearing my work uniform, minus the newsboy</p>
<p>cap, vest, and pintuck shirt. Luckily, I’d slipped a camisole on</p>
<p>before heading out to work, but I had nothing to replace the</p>
<p>tweed slacks.</p>
<p>tweed slacks.</p>
<p>“So tell me, Grey. What are you doing here? I gotta tell you, I</p>
<p>thought you’d turn me down for next week’s homework.”</p>
<p>I leaned back in the sand beside him and slanted a look in</p>
<p>his direction. “The jerk act is starting to get old. So I’m lame. So</p>
<p>what?”</p>
<p>He grinned. “I like lame. Lame is going to help me pass my</p>
<p>junior year. Particularly English.”</p>
<p>Oh boy. “If that was a question, the answer is no, I will not</p>
<p>write your English papers.”</p>
<p>“That’s what you think. I haven’t started working the Scott</p>
<p>Charm yet.”</p>
<p>I snorted laughter, and his grin deepened. He said, “What?</p>
<p>Don’t believe me?”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe you and the word ‘charm’ belong in the same</p>
<p>sentence.”</p>
<p>“No girl can resist the Charm. I’m telling you, they go wild for</p>
<p>it. Here are the basics: I’m drunk twenty-four/seven, I can’t hold</p>
<p>a job, can’t pass basic math, and I spend my days playing video</p>
<p>games and passing out.”</p>
<p>I flung my head back, feeling my shoulders shake as I</p>
<p>laughed. I was beginning to think I liked the drunk version of</p>
<p>Scott better than the sober one. Who would have figured Scott</p>
<p>for self-deprecating?</p>
<p>“Quit drooling,” Scott said, playfully tipping my chip up. “It’s</p>
<p>going to go to my head.”</p>
<p>I gave him a relaxed smile. “You drive a Mustang. That should</p>
<p>give you ten points at least.”</p>
<p>“Awesome. Ten points. All I need is another two hundred to</p>
<p>get out of the red zone.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you quit drinking?” I suggested.</p>
<p>“Quit? You kidding? My life sucks when I’m only half-aware of</p>
<p>it. If I quit drinking and saw what it’s really like, I’d probably jump</p>
<p>off a bridge.” We were quiet a moment.</p>
<p>“When I’m wasted, I can almost forget who I am,” he said, his</p>
<p>smile fading slightly. “I know I’m still there, but only barely. It’s a</p>
<p>good place to be.” He tipped back the thermos, eyes on the</p>
<p>dark sea straight ahead.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, my life isn’t so great either.”</p>
<p>“Your dad?” he guessed, wiping his upper lip with the back of</p>
<p>his hand. “That wasn’t your fault.”</p>
<p>“Which almost makes it worse.”</p>
<p>“How so?”</p>
<p>“If it were my fault, that would imply I messed up. I’d blame</p>
<p>myself for a long time, but maybe eventually I could move on.</p>
<p>Right now I’m stuck, facing down the same question: Why my</p>
<p>dad?”</p>
<p>“Fair enough,” Scott said.</p>
<p>A soft rain started to fall. Summer rain, with big warm drops</p>
<p>splattering everywhere.</p>
<p>“What the hell?” I heard Marcie demand from farther down</p>
<p>the beach, near the bonfire. I studied the outlines of bodies as</p>
<p>people began shuffling to their feet. Patch wasn’t among them.</p>
<p>“My apartment, everyone!” Scott hollered out, jumping to his</p>
<p>feet with a flourish. He staggered sideways, barely hanging on</p>
<p>to his balance. “Seventy-two Deacon Road, apartment thirtytwo.</p>
<p>Doors are unlocked. Plenty of beer in the fridge. Oh, and</p>
<p>did Imention my mom’s at Bunco all night?”</p>
<p>A cheer went up, and everyone grabbed their shoes and</p>
<p>other discarded clothing items and hiked up the sand toward</p>
<p>the parking lot.</p>
<p>Scott nudged my thigh with his flip-flop. “Need a ride?</p>
<p>C’mon, I’ll even let you drive.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for the offer, but I think I’m done.” Patch wasn’t here.</p>
<p>He was the sole reason I’d come, and suddenly the night felt not</p>
<p>only like a letdown, but a waste as well. I should have been</p>
<p>relieved at not having to see Patch and Marcie together, but I</p>
<p>mostly felt disappointed, lonely, and full of regret. And</p>
<p>exhausted. The only thing on my mind was crawling into bed</p>
<p>and putting an end to this day as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“Friends don’t let friends drive drunk,” Scott coaxed.</p>
<p>“Are you trying to appeal to my conscience?”</p>
<p>He dangled the keys in front of me. “How can you turn down a</p>
<p>once-in-a-lifetime chance to drive the ’Stang?”</p>
<p>I got to my feet and brushed sand off the seat of my pants.</p>
<p>“How about you sell me the ’Stang for thirty dollars? I can even</p>
<p>pay cash.”</p>
<p>He laughed, slinging his arm around my shoulders. “Drunk,</p>
<p>but not that drunk, Grey.”</p><p>

<p></p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>ONCE BACK INSIDE COLDWATER’S CITY LIMITS, I drove the Mustang</p>
<p>across town and took Beech to Deacon. The rain continued to</p>
<p>patter down in a somber drizzle. The road was narrow and</p>
<p>winding, evergreen trees crowding right up to the edge of the</p>
<p>pavement. Around the next bend, Scott pointed to a complex of</p>
<p>Cape Cod–style apartments with tiny balconies and gray</p>
<p>shingles. There was a run-down tennis court on the small lawn</p>
<p>out front. The whole place looked like it could use a fresh coat</p>
<p>of paint.</p>
<p>I angled the Mustang into a parking space.</p>
<p>“Thanks for the ride,” Scott said, draping his arm on the back</p>
<p>of my seat. His eyes were glassy, his smile hitched up lazily on</p>
<p>one side.</p>
<p>“Can you make it inside?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to go inside,” he slurred. “The carpet smells like</p>
<p>dog urine and the bathroom ceiling has mold. I want to stay out</p>
<p>here, with you.”</p>
<p>Because you’re drunk. “I have to get home. It’s late, and I still</p>
<p>haven’t called my mom today. She’s going to freak out if I don’t</p>
<p>check in soon.” I reached across him and pushed open the</p>
<p>passenger door.</p>
<p>As I did, he coiled a lock of my hair around his finger. “Pretty.”</p>
<p>I unwound the curl. “This isn’t going to happen. You’re drunk.”</p>
<p>He grinned. “Just a little.”</p>
<p>“You’re not going to remember this tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“I thought we had a bonding moment back at the beach.”</p>
<p>“We did. And that’s as far as our bond is going. I’m serious.</p>
<p>I’m kicking you out. Go inside.”</p>
<p>“What about my car?”</p>
<p>“I’ll take it home tonight, then bring it by tomorrow afternoon.”</p>
<p>Scott exhaled contentedly and relaxed deeper into his seat. “I</p>
<p>want to go inside and chill solo with Jimi Hendrix. Would you tell</p>
<p>everyone the party’s over?”</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes. “You just invited sixty people over. I’m not</p>
<p>going to go in and tell them it’s called off.”</p>
<p>Scott bent sideways out the door and threw up.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>I grabbed the back of his shirt, lugged him inside the car, and</p>
<p>gave the Mustang enough gas to roll it forward two feet. Then I</p>
<p>engaged the foot brake and swung out. I walked around to</p>
<p>Scott’s side and dragged him out of the car by his arms, being</p>
<p>careful to avoid planting my foot in the contents of his emptied</p>
<p>stomach. He flung his arm over my shoulder, and it was all I</p>
<p>could do to keep from collapsing under his weight. “Which</p>
<p>apartment?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Thirty-two. Top right.”</p>
<p>The top floor. Of course. Why should I expect to catch a</p>
<p>break now?</p>
<p>I dragged Scott up both flights of stairs, panting hard, and</p>
<p>I dragged Scott up both flights of stairs, panting hard, and</p>
<p>staggered through the open door of his apartment, which was</p>
<p>alive with the chaos of bodies pulsing and grinding to rap turned</p>
<p>up so loud I could feel pieces of my brain shaking loose.</p>
<p>“Bedroom’s at the back,” Scott murmured in my ear.</p>
<p>I pushed him forward through the crowd, opened the door at</p>
<p>the end of the hall, and dumped Scott on the bottom mattress of</p>
<p>the bunk bed in the corner. There was a small desk in the</p>
<p>adjacent corner, a collapsible cloth hamper, a guitar stand, and</p>
<p>a few free weights. The walls were aged white and sparsely</p>
<p>decorated with a movie poster for The Godfather Part III and a</p>
<p>New England Patriots pennant.</p>
<p>“My room,” Scott said, catching me taking in the</p>
<p>surroundings. He patted the mattress beside him. “Make</p>
<p>yourself comfortable.”</p>
<p>“Good night, Scott.”</p>
<p>I started to pull the door shut when he said, “Can you get me</p>
<p>a drink? Water. I got to wash this taste out of my mouth.”</p>
<p>I was antsy to get out of the place but couldn’t help feeling an</p>
<p>aggravating tug of sympathy for Scott. If I left now, he’d probably</p>
<p>wake tomorrow in a pool of his own vomit. I might as well clean</p>
<p>him up and get him some ibuprofen.</p>
<p>The apartment’s tiny U-shaped kitchen looked out on the</p>
<p>living-room-turned-dance floor, and after squeezing through the</p>
<p>packed-in bodies blocking the kitchen’s entrance, I opened and</p>
<p>closed cabinets, hunting for a glass. I found a stack of white</p>
<p>plastic cups above the sink, flipped on the tap, and held a cup</p>
<p>under the faucet. As I was turning to carry the water back to</p>
<p>Scott, my heart jumped. Patch stood several feet away, leaning</p>
<p>against the cupboards opposite the refrigerator. He’d</p>
<p>separated himself from the crowd, and his ball cap was pulled</p>
<p>low, signaling he wasn’t interested in soliciting conversation.</p>
<p>His stance was impatient. He glanced at his watch.</p>
<p>Seeing no way to avoid him, aside from climbing over the</p>
<p>counter directly into the living room, and feeling I owed him</p>
<p>civility—plus, weren’t we both old enough to handle this</p>
<p>maturely?—I moistened my lips, which suddenly felt dry as</p>
<p>sand, and walked over. “Having fun?”</p>
<p>The hard lines of his face softened into a smile. “I can think of</p>
<p>at least one thing I’d rather be doing.”</p>
<p>If that was an innuendo, I was going to ignore it. I boosted</p>
<p>myself onto the kitchen counter, legs dangling over the edge.</p>
<p>“Staying the whole night?”</p>
<p>“If I have to stay the whole night, shoot me now.”</p>
<p>I spread my hands. “No gun, sorry.”</p>
<p>His smile was bad-boy perfection. “That’s all that’s stopping</p>
<p>you?”</p>
<p>“Shooting you wouldn’t kill you,” I pointed out. “One of the</p>
<p>downsides of being immortal.”</p>
<p>He nodded, a fierce smile creeping out beneath the shadow</p>
<p>of his ball cap. “But you would if you could?”</p>
<p>I hesitated before answering. “I don’t hate you, Patch. Yet.”</p>
<p>“Hate’s not strong enough?” he guessed. “Something</p>
<p>deeper?”</p>
<p>I smiled, but not enough to show teeth. We both seemed to sense that nothing good would come of</p>
<p>We both seemed to sense that nothing good would come of</p>
<p>this conversation, especially not here, and Patch rescued both</p>
<p>of us by tipping his head toward the crowd behind us. “And</p>
<p>you? Staying long?”</p>
<p>I hopped down off the counter. “Nope. I’m delivering water to</p>
<p>Scott, and mouthwash if I can find it, then I’m out of here.”</p>
<p>He caught my elbow. “You’d shoot me, but you’re on your way</p>
<p>to nurse Scott’s hangover?”</p>
<p>“Scott didn’t break my heart.”</p>
<p>A couple of beats of silence fell between us, then Patch said</p>
<p>in a low voice, “Let’s go.” The way he looked at me told me</p>
<p>exactly what he meant. He wanted me to run away with him. To</p>
<p>defy the archangels. To ignore that they’d eventually find Patch.</p>
<p>I couldn’t think about what they’d do to him without feeling</p>
<p>trapped in ice, cold with fear, and frozen by the sheer horror of</p>
<p>it. Patch had never told me what hell would be like. But he knew.</p>
<p>And the fact that he wasn’t telling me painted a very vivid, very</p>
<p>bleak picture.</p>
<p>I kept my eyes nailed to the living room. “I promised Scott a</p>
<p>glass of water.”</p>
<p>“You’re spending a lot of time with a guy I’d call dark, and</p>
<p>given my standard, that’s a hard-won title.”</p>
<p>“Takes a dark prince to know one?”</p>
<p>“Glad you’ve hung on to your sense of humor, but I’m serious.</p>
<p>Be careful.”</p>
<p>I nodded. “I appreciate your concern, but I know what I’m</p>
<p>doing.” I sidestepped Patch and edged through the gyrating</p>
<p>bodies in the living room. I had to get away. It was too much</p>
<p>standing close to him, feeling that wall of ice so thick and</p>
<p>impenetrable. Knowing we both wanted something we couldn’t</p>
<p>have, even though what we wanted stood an arm’s reach away.</p>
<p>I’d made it about halfway through the crowd when someone</p>
<p>snagged the strap of my cami from behind. I turned back,</p>
<p>expecting to find Patch ready to give me more of his opinion, or</p>
<p>maybe, more terrifying, throwing caution to the wind to kiss me,</p>
<p>but it was Scott, grinning lazily down at me. He brushed my hair</p>
<p>off my face and leaned in, sealing my mouth with his. He tasted</p>
<p>like mint mouthwash and freshly scrubbed teeth. I started to</p>
<p>draw back, then realized, what did I care if Patch saw? I wasn’t</p>
<p>doing anything he hadn’t already. I had just as much right to</p>
<p>move on as he did. He was using Marcie to fill the void in his</p>
<p>heart, and now it was my turn, with Scott.</p>
<p>I slid my hands up Scott’s chest and laced them behind his</p>
<p>neck. He took the cue and pulled me in tighter, tracing his hands</p>
<p>down the contour of my spine. So this was what it felt like to kiss</p>
<p>someone else. While Patch was slow and practiced and took</p>
<p>his time, Scott was playfully eager and a little sloppy. It was</p>
<p>completely different and new … and not altogether bad.</p>
<p>“My room,” Scott whispered in my ear, lacing his fingers</p>
<p>between mine and pulling me toward the hall.</p>
<p>I flicked my gaze to where I’d last seen Patch. Our eyes met.</p>
<p>His hand was stiff, cupped at the back of his neck, as if he’d</p>
<p>been lost in deep thought and had frozen at the sight of me</p>
<p>kissing Scott.</p>
<p>This is what it feels like, I thought at him.</p>
<p>Only, I didn’t feel any better after thinking it. I felt sad and low</p>
<p>and dissatisfied. I wasn’t the kind of person who played games</p>
<p>or relied on dirty tricks to console myself or boost my selfesteem.</p>
<p>But there was still a certain raw pain burning inside</p>
<p>me, and because of it, I let Scott guide me down the hall.</p>
<p>Using his foot, Scott nudged open the bedroom door. He</p>
<p>killed the lights, and soft shadows settled around us. I glanced</p>
<p>at the small twin mattress on the bottom bunk, then at the</p>
<p>window. The window was cracked. In a panic-induced moment,</p>
<p>I actually imagined myself slipping through the crack and</p>
<p>disappearing into the night. Probably a sign that what I was</p>
<p>about to do was a huge mistake. Was I really going through with</p>
<p>this just to make a point? Was this how I wanted to show Patch</p>
<p>the magnitude of my anger and hurt? What did it say about me?</p>
<p>Scott took me by the shoulders and kissed me harder. I</p>
<p>mentally flipped through my options. I could tell Scott I was</p>
<p>feeling sick. I could tell him I’d changed my mind. I could simply</p>
<p>tell him no….</p>
<p>Scott shucked off his shirt and tossed it aside.</p>
<p>“Uh—,” I began. I looked around once more for an escape,</p>
<p>noting that the bedroom door must have opened, because a</p>
<p>shadow blotted out the light spilling in from the hall. The shadow</p>
<p>stepped inside and closed the door, and I felt my jaw go slack.</p>
<p>Patch tossed Scott’s shirt at him, catching him in the face.</p>
<p>“What the—,” Scott demanded, yanking the shirt over his</p>
<p>head and rolling it down to cover himself.</p>
<p>“Fly’s down,” Patch told him.</p>
<p>Scott yanked on his zipper. “What are you doing? You can’t</p>
<p>Scott yanked on his zipper. “What are you doing? You can’t</p>
<p>come in here. I’m busy.And this is my room!”</p>
<p>“Are you insane?” I told Patch, blood rising in my cheeks.</p>
<p>Patch sliced his eyes toward me. “You don’t want to be here.</p>
<p>Not with him.”</p>
<p>“You don’t get to make that call!”</p>
<p>Scott brushed past me. “Let me take care of him.”</p>
<p>He made it another two feet before Patch shoved his fist into</p>
<p>Scott’s jaw with a sickening crunch.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” I yelled at Patch. “Did you break his</p>
<p>jaw?”</p>
<p>“Unnuh!” Scott moaned, clutching the lower half of his face.</p>
<p>“I didn’t break his jaw, but if he lays a hand on you, it will be</p>
<p>the first of many things to break,” Patch said.</p>
<p>“Out!” I ordered Patch, thrusting a finger at the door.</p>
<p>“I’m going to kill you,” Scott growled at Patch, opening and</p>
<p>closing his jaw, making sure it still worked.</p>
<p>But instead of taking the cue to leave, Patch crossed to Scott</p>
<p>in three steps. He flung him around to face the wall. Scott tried</p>
<p>to get his bearings, but Patch slammed him against the wall</p>
<p>again, disorienting him further. “Touch her,” he said in Scott’s</p>
<p>ear, his voice low and threatening, “and it’ll be the biggest</p>
<p>regret of your life.”</p>
<p>Before leaving, Patch flicked his eyes once in my direction.</p>
<p>“He’s not worth it.” He paused. “And neither am I.”</p>
<p>I opened my mouth but didn’t have an argument. Iwasn’t here</p>
<p>because I wanted to be. I was here to shove it in Patch’s face. I</p>
<p>knew it, and he knew it.</p>
<p>Scott rolled around, slouching against the wall. “I could’ve</p>
<p>taken him if I wasn’t wasted,” he said, massaging the lower half</p>
<p>of his face. “Who the hell does he think he is? I don’t even know</p>
<p>him. You know him?”</p>
<p>Scott obviously didn’t recognize Patch from the Z, but there</p>
<p>had been a lot of people there that night. I couldn’t expect Scott</p>
<p>to remember every face. “I’m sorry about that,” I said, gesturing</p>
<p>at the door Patch had just exited through. “Are you okay?”</p>
<p>He smiled slowly. “Never been better.” That said with a weltlike</p>
<p>bruise blooming across his jaw.</p>
<p>“He was out of control.”</p>
<p>“Best way to be,” he drawled, using the back of his hand to</p>
<p>wipe a ribbon of blood from the crack of his mouth.</p>
<p>“I should go,” I said. “I’ll bring the Mustang back after school</p>
<p>tomorrow.” I wondered how I was supposed to walk out of here,</p>
<p>past Patch, and maintain any level of self-dignity. I might as well</p>
<p>stroll up to him and admit he was right: I’d only followed Scott</p>
<p>back here to hurt him.</p>
<p>Scott crooked his finger under my shirt, holding me in place.</p>
<p>“Don’t go, Nora. Not yet.”</p>
<p>I unhooked his finger. “Scott—”</p>
<p>“Tell me if I’m going too far,” he said, tugging his shirt up over</p>
<p>his head for the second time. His pale skin glowed in the dark.</p>
<p>He’d clearly been spending a lot of time in the weight room, and</p>
<p>it showed in the lines of muscle branching down his arms.</p>
<p>“You’re going too far,” I said.</p>
<p>“That didn’t sound convincing.” He swept my hair off my neck</p>
<p>and nuzzled his face in the curve.</p>
<p>and nuzzled his face in the curve.</p>
<p>“I’m not interested in you this way,” I said, putting my hands</p>
<p>between us. I was tired, and a headache was buzzing between</p>
<p>my ears. I was ashamed of myself and wanted to go home and</p>
<p>sleep and sleep until I forgot this night.</p>
<p>“How do you know? You’ve never tried me this way.”</p>
<p>I flipped on the light switch, flooding the room with light. Scott</p>
<p>threw a hand over his eyes and staggered back a step.</p>
<p>“I’m leaving—,” I began, then broke off as my eyes fixed on a</p>
<p>patch of skin high on Scott’s chest, halfway between his nipple</p>
<p>and collarbone. The skin was warped and shiny. Somewhere</p>
<p>deep in my brain, I made the connection that this must be the</p>
<p>branding mark Scott had been given when he swore allegiance</p>
<p>to the Nephilim blood society, but it felt like a hazy afterthought,</p>
<p>dull in comparison to what had really arrested my attention. The</p>
<p>brand was in the shape of a clenched fist. It was identical, down</p>
<p>to the exact shape and size, to the raised stamp on the iron ring</p>
<p>from the envelope. With a hand still flung over his eyes, Scott groaned and</p>
<p>reached for the bedpost to steady himself.</p>
<p>“What’s that mark on your skin?” I asked, my mouth gone dry.</p>
<p>Scott looked momentarily startled, then slid his hand down to</p>
<p>cover the mark. “Some friends and I were horsing around one</p>
<p>night. It’s nothing serious. It’s only a scar.”</p>
<p>He had the audacity to lie about it? “You gave me the</p>
<p>envelope.” When he didn’t answer, I added more fiercely, “The</p>
<p>boardwalk. The bakery. The envelope with the iron ring.” The</p>
<p>room felt eerily isolated, detached from the throbbing bass out</p>
<p>in the living room. In an instant, I no longer felt safe trapped</p>
<p>back here with Scott.</p>
<p>Scott’s eyes narrowed and he squinted at me through the</p>
<p>light, which still seemed to hurt his eyes. “What are you talking</p>
<p>about?” His tone was wary, hostile, muddled.</p>
<p>“You think this act is funny? I know you gave me the ring.”</p>
<p>“The—ring?”</p>
<p>“The ring that made that mark on your chest!”</p>
<p>He shook his head once, hard, as if to shake off his stupor.</p>
<p>Then his arm lashed out, shoving me up against the wall. “How</p>
<p>do you know about the ring?”</p>
<p>“You’re hurting me,” I said with venom, but I was shivering</p>
<p>with fear. I realized that Scott wasn’t pretending. Unless he was</p>
<p>a much better actor than I imagined, he genuinely didn’t know</p>
<p>about the envelope. But he did know about the ring.</p>
<p>“What did he look like?” He fisted my camisole and shook</p>
<p>me. “The guy who gave you the ring—what did he look like?”</p>
<p>“Get your hands off me,” I ordered, pushing back. But Scott</p>
<p>weighed a lot more than me, and his feet stayed planted, his</p>
<p>body trapping me against the wall. “I didn’t see him. He had it</p>
<p>delivered.”</p>
<p>“Does he know where I am? Does he know I’m in</p>
<p>Coldwater?”</p>
<p>“He?” I snapped back. “Who is he? What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“Why did he give you the ring?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know! I don’t know anything about him! Why don’t you</p>
<p>tell me?”</p>
<p>He shuddered hard against the raging panic that seemed to</p>
<p>grip him. “What do you know?”</p>
<p>I kept my eyes nailed to Scott’s, but my throat was clenched</p>
<p>so hard it hurt to breathe. “The ring was in the envelope with a</p>
<p>note that said the Black Hand killed my dad. And that the ring</p>
<p>belonged to him.” I licked my lips. “Are you the Black Hand?”</p>
<p>Scott’s expression still held deep distrust; his eyes darted</p>
<p>back and forth, judging whether or not he believed me. “Forget</p>
<p>we had this conversation, if you know what’s good for you.”</p>
<p>I tried to yank my arm free, but he was still holding on.</p>
<p>“Get out,” he said. “And stay away from me.” This time he let</p>
<p>go, giving me a shove in the direction of the door.</p>
<p>I stopped at the door. I wiped my sweaty palms on my pants.</p>
<p>“Not until you tell me about the Black Hand.”</p>
<p>I thought Scott might throw an even more violent rage, but he</p>
<p>merely nailed me with a look he might give a dog if he caught it</p>
<p>squatting on his lawn. He scooped up his T-shirt and made like</p>
<p>he was going to stretch it back over his frame, then his mouth</p>
<p>curled into a threatening smile. He threw the shirt on the bed.</p>
<p>He loosened his belt, yanked down his zipper, and stepped out</p>
<p>of his shorts, leaving him standing in nothing but fitted cotton</p>
<p>boxers. He was going for the shock factor, clearly trying to</p>
<p>intimidate me into leaving. He’d done a pretty good job of</p>
<p>convincing me, but I wasn’t going to let him get rid of me that</p>
<p>easily.</p>
<p>I said, “You have the Black Hand’s ring branded on your skin.</p>
<p>Don’t expect me to believe you know nothing about it, including</p>
<p>how it got there.”</p>
<p>He didn’t answer.</p>
<p>“The minute I walk out of here, I’m calling the police. If you</p>
<p>won’t talk to me, maybe you’d like to talk to them. Maybe</p>
<p>they’ve seen the branding before. I can tell just by looking at it</p>
<p>that it isn’t good.” My voice was calm, but my underarms were</p>
<p>damp. What a stupid and risky thing to say. What if Scott didn’t</p>
<p>allow me to leave? I obviously knew enough about the Black</p>
<p>Hand to upset him. Did he think I knew too much? What if he</p>
<p>killed me, then threw my body in a Dumpster? My mom didn’t</p>
<p>know where I was, and everyone who’d seen me enter Scott’s</p>
<p>apartment was wasted. Would anyone remember having seen</p>
<p>me tomorrow?</p>
<p>I was so busy panicking, I hadn’t noticed Scott had taken a</p>
<p>seat on his bed. His face was bent into his hands. His back was</p>
<p>quivering, and I realized he was crying silently, great, convulsive</p>
<p>sobs. At first I thought he was faking, that this was some kind of</p>
<p>trap, but the choked sounds low in his chest were real. He was</p>
<p>drunk, emotionally unhinged, and I didn’t know how stable that</p>
<p>made him. I held still, afraid one slight movement might cause</p>
<p>him to snap.</p>
<p>“I racked up a lot of gambling debt in Portland,” he said, his</p>
<p>voice scratchy with desperation and exhaustion. “The manager</p>
<p>at the pool hall was breathing down my neck, demanding the</p>
<p>money, and I had to watch my back anytime I left the house. I</p>
<p>was living in fear, knowing one day he’d find me, and I’d be</p>
<p>lucky to get off with broken kneecaps.</p>
<p>“One night on my way home from work, I was jumped from</p>
<p>“One night on my way home from work, I was jumped from</p>
<p>behind, dragged into a warehouse, and tied to a folding table. It</p>
<p>was too dark to see the guy, but I figured the manager had sent</p>
<p>him. I told him I’d pay him whatever he wanted if he’d let me go,</p>
<p>but he laughed and said he wasn’t after my money—in fact,</p>
<p>he’d already settled my debts. Before I could figure out if it was</p>
<p>his idea of a joke, he said he was the Black Hand, and the last</p>
<p>thing he needed was more money.</p>
<p>“He had a Zippo, and he held the flame against the ring on</p>
<p>his left hand, heating it. I was sweating bullets. I told him I’d do</p>
<p>whatever he wanted—just get me off the table. He ripped open</p>
<p>my shirt and ground the ring into my chest. My skin was on fire,</p>
<p>and I was yelling at the top of my lungs. He snapped my finger,</p>
<p>broke the bone, and told me if I didn’t shut up, he’d move down</p>
<p>the line until he broke all ten. He told me he’d given me his</p>
<p>mark.” Scott’s voice had dropped to a rasp. “I wet my pants.</p>
<p>Right there on the table. He scared the hell out of me. I’ll do</p>
<p>whatever it takes to never see him again. That’s why we moved</p>
<p>back to Coldwater. I’d stopped going to school and was hiding</p>
<p>out at the gym all day, bulking up in case he came looking for</p>
<p>me. If he found me, this time I was going to be ready.” Cutting</p>
<p>off there, he wiped his nose with the back of his hand.</p>
<p>I didn’t know if I could trust him. Patch had made it clear he</p>
<p>didn’t, but Scott was shaking. His complexion was pasty,</p>
<p>misted with sweat, and he plowed his hands through his hair,</p>
<p>letting go of a long, wavering breath. Could he make up a story</p>
<p>like that? All the details meshed with everything I already knew</p>
<p>about Scott. He had a gambling addiction. He’d worked nights</p>
<p>in Portland at a convenience store. He’d moved back to</p>
<p>Coldwater to escape his past. He had the branding mark on his</p>
<p>chest, proof someone had put it there. Could he sit two feet</p>
<p>away and lie to me about what he’d gone through?</p>
<p>“What did he look like?” I asked. “The Black Hand.”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “It was dark. He was tall, that’s all I</p>
<p>remember.”</p>
<p>I groped for some way to connect Scott and my dad—both of</p>
<p>whom were linked to the Black Hand. Scott had been tracked</p>
<p>down by the Black Hand after running up debt. In exchange for</p>
<p>paying off Scott’s debt, the Black Hand had branded him. Had</p>
<p>my dad gone through the same thing? Had his murder not been</p>
<p>as random as the police originally guessed? Had the Black</p>
<p>Hand paid off a debt my dad owed, then killed him when my</p>
<p>dad refused to be branded? No. I wasn’t buying it. My dad</p>
<p>didn’t gamble, and he didn’t rack up debt. He was an</p>
<p>accountant. He knew the value of money. Nothing about his</p>
<p>situation tied him to Scott. There had to be something else.</p>
<p>“Did the Black Hand say anything else?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I try not to remember anything about that night.” He reached</p>
<p>under his mattress and pulled out a plastic ashtray and a pack</p>
<p>of cigarettes. He lit up, exhaling smoke slowly, and closed his</p>
<p>eyes.</p>
<p>My mind kept rebounding to the same three questions. Had</p>
<p>the Black Hand really killed my dad? Who was he? Where</p>
<p>could I find him?</p>
<p>And then a new question. Was the Black Hand the leader of</p>
<p>the Nephilim blood society? If he was the one branding</p>
<p>Nephilim, it made sense. Only a leader, or someone with a lot of</p>
<p>authority, would be in charge of actively recruiting members to</p>
<p>fight back against fallen angels.</p>
<p>“Did he say why he gave you his mark?” I asked. Clearly the</p>
<p>branding was to mark members of the blood society, but maybe</p>
<p>there was more. Something only its Nephilim members knew.</p>
<p>Scott shook his head, taking another drag.</p>
<p>“He didn’t give you any reason?”</p>
<p>“No,” Scott snapped.</p>
<p>“Has he come looking for you since that night?”</p>
<p>“No.” I could tell by the wild look in his eyes that he was</p>
<p>scared he wouldn’t always be able to say as much.</p>
<p>I thought back to the Z. To the red-shirted Nephil. Did he have</p>
<p>the same brand as Scott? I was almost certain he did. It only</p>
<p>made sense that all members had the same mark. Which</p>
<p>meant there were others like Scott and the Nephil at the Z.</p>
<p>Members every where, recruited by force, but disjointed from</p>
<p>any real strength or purpose because they were kept in the</p>
<p>dark. What was the Black Hand waiting for? Why was he</p>
<p>holding off uniting his members? To keep fallen angels from</p>
<p>finding out what he was up to?</p>
<p>Was this why my dad was murdered? Because of something</p>
<p>that had to do with the blood society?</p>
<p>“Have you ever seen the Black Hand’s brand on anyone</p>
<p>else?” I knew I was in danger of pushing too hard, but I needed</p>
<p>to determine just how much Scott knew.</p>
<p>Scott didn’t answer. He was crumpled on the bed, passed</p>
<p>out. His mouth was agape, and his breath smelled strongly of</p>
<p>alcohol and smoke.</p>
<p>I shook him gently. “Scott? What can you tell me about the</p>
<p>society?” I slapped his cheeks gently. “Scott, wake up. Did the</p>
<p>Black Hand tell you that you’re Nephilim? Did he tell you what it</p>
<p>means?”</p>
<p>But he had crashed into a deep, inebriated sleep.</p>
<p>I ground out his cigarette, pulled a sheet up to his shoulders,</p>
<p>and let myself out.</p><p>

<p></p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>I WAS DEEP IN ADREAM WHEN THE PHONE SHRILLED. I stuck an arm</p>
<p>out sideways, swept my hand over the night-stand, and located</p>
<p>my cell phone. “Hello?” I said, wiping drool from the rim of my</p>
<p>mouth.</p>
<p>“Have you checked the Weather Channel yet?” Vee asked.</p>
<p>“What?” I mumbled. I tried to blink my eyes open, but they</p>
<p>were still rolled back in the dream. “What time is it?”</p>
<p>“Blue skies, sizzling temps, zero wind. We are so going to</p>
<p>Old Orchard Beach after class. I’m packing boogie boards in</p>
<p>the Neon right now.” She belted out the first stanza to “Summer</p>
<p>Nights” from Grease. I cringed and pulled the phone away from</p>
<p>my ear.</p>
<p>I rubbed sleep out of my eyes and watched the numbers on</p>
<p>the clock seesaw into focus. That couldn’t possibly be a six at</p>
<p>the front … could it?</p>
<p>“Should I wear a hot pink bandeau, or a metallic gold bikini?</p>
<p>The thing about the bikini is, I probably need a tan before Iwear</p>
<p>it. Gold will make my skin look even more washed out. Maybe</p>
<p>I’ll wear pink this time, get a base tan, and—”</p>
<p>“Why does my clock say six twenty-five?” I demanded, trying</p>
<p>to wade through the haze of sleep long enough to push some</p>
<p>volume into my voice.</p>
<p>“Is this a trick question?”</p>
<p>“Vee!”</p>
<p>“Yeesh.Angry much?”</p>
<p>I slammed the phone down and snuggled deeper under the</p>
<p>covers. The home phone started ringing downstairs in the</p>
<p>kitchen. I folded my pillow over my head. The answering</p>
<p>machine picked up, but Vee wasn’t that easy to get rid of. She</p>
<p>redialed.Again and again.</p>
<p>I speed-dialed her cell. “What?”</p>
<p>“Gold or pink? I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t important. It’s just …</p>
<p>Rixon’s going to be there, and this is the first time he’ll see me</p>
<p>in a swimsuit.”</p>
<p>“Back up. The plan is for all three of us to go together? I’m</p>
<p>not going all the way out to Old Orchard Beach to be the third</p>
<p>wheel!”</p>
<p>“And I’m not going to let you sit home all afternoon with your</p>
<p>sour face on.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have a sour face.”</p>
<p>“Yes, you do.And you’re wearing it right now.”</p>
<p>“This is my annoyed face. You woke me up at six in the</p>
<p>morning!”</p>
<p>The sky was summer blue from horizon to horizon. The Neon’s</p>
<p>windows were rolled down, a hot wind ripped through Vee’s and</p>
<p>my hair, and the heady smell of salt water filled the air. Vee</p>
<p>exited off the highway and drove downOld Orchard Street, eyes</p>
<p>peeled for parking. The lanes on both sides of the street were</p>
<p>backed up with slow-moving cars that rolled along well under</p>
<p>the speed limit, hoping for a spot to open up on the street</p>
<p>before they slipped past and lost their chance.</p>
<p>“This place is packed,” Vee complained. “Where am I</p>
<p>supposed to park?” She steered down an alley and slowed to a</p>
<p>stop behind a bookstore. “This looks good. Lots of parking</p>
<p>back here.”</p>
<p>“The sign says employee parking only.”</p>
<p>“How are they going to know we aren’t employees? The</p>
<p>Neon blends right in.All these cars speak low class.”</p>
<p>“The sign says violators will be towed.”</p>
<p>“They just say that to scare people like you and me away. It’s</p>
<p>an empty threat. Nothing to worry about.”</p>
<p>She wedged the Neon into a space and cranked the parking</p>
<p>brake. We grabbed an umbrella and a tote filled with bottled</p>
<p>water, snacks, sunscreen, and towels out of the trunk, then</p>
<p>hiked down Old Orchard Street until it dead-ended at the</p>
<p>beach. The sand was dotted with colorful umbrellas, the frothy</p>
<p>waves rolling under the twiggy legs of the pier. I recognized a</p>
<p>group of soon-to-be senior guys from school playing Ultimate</p>
<p>Frisbee just ahead.</p>
<p>“Normally I’d say we should go check out those guys,” Vee</p>
<p>said, “but Rixon is so hot, I’m not even tempted.”</p>
<p>“When is Rixon supposed to get here, anyway?”</p>
<p>“Hey now. That didn’t sound very cheerful. In fact, it sounded</p>
<p>just a little bit cynical.”</p>
<p>Shielding my eyes, I squinted at the coastline, looking for an</p>
<p>Shielding my eyes, I squinted at the coastline, looking for an</p>
<p>ideal place to pitch the umbrella. “I already told you: I hate being</p>
<p>the third wheel.” The last thing I needed or wanted was to sit</p>
<p>under a hot sun all afternoon, watching Vee and Rixon make</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>“For your information, Rixon had a few errands to run, but he</p>
<p>promised to be here by three.”</p>
<p>“What kind of errands?”</p>
<p>“Who knows? Probably Patch roped him into doing a favor.</p>
<p>Patch always has something he needs Rixon to run off and take</p>
<p>care of. You’d think Patch could just do it himself. Or at least pay</p>
<p>Rixon, so he’s not taking advantage of him. Do you think I</p>
<p>should wear sunscreen? I’m going to be really mad if I go to all</p>
<p>this trouble and don’t get a tan.”</p>
<p>“Rixon doesn’t seem like the kind of guy who lets people</p>
<p>take advantage of him.”</p>
<p>“People? No. Patch? Yes. It’s like Rixon worships him. It’s so</p>
<p>lame. It makes my stomach heave. Patch is not the kind of guy I</p>
<p>want my boyfriend aspiring to be.”</p>
<p>“They have a long history together.”</p>
<p>“So I’ve heard. Blah, blah, blah. Probably Patch is a drug</p>
<p>dealer. No. Probably he’s an arms dealer and has Rixon out</p>
<p>playing the sacrificial mule, gunrunning for free and risking his</p>
<p>neck.”</p>
<p>Behind my knockoff Ray-Bans, I rolled my eyes. “Does Rixon</p>
<p>have a problem with their relationship?”</p>
<p>“No,” she said, all huffy.</p>
<p>“Then leave it at that.”</p>
<p>But Vee wasn’t about to let it go. “If Patch isn’t dealing in</p>
<p>arms, how’s he get all his cash?”</p>
<p>“You know where he gets his money.”</p>
<p>“Tell me,” she said, folding her arms stubbornly across her</p>
<p>chest. “Tell me out loud where he gets his money.”</p>
<p>“The same place Rixon gets his.”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh. Just as I thought. You’re ashamed to say it.”</p>
<p>I gave her a pointed look. “Please. That’s the dumbest thing</p>
<p>ever.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah?” Vee marched up to a woman not far away who</p>
<p>was building a sand castle with two small children. “Excuse me,</p>
<p>ma’am? Sorry to interrupt your quality beach time with the little</p>
<p>ones, but my friend here would like to tell you what her ex does</p>
<p>for a living.”</p>
<p>I clamped my hand around Vee’s arm and dragged her away.</p>
<p>“See?” Vee said. “You’re ashamed. You can’t say it out loud</p>
<p>and not feel your insides start to rot.”</p>
<p>“Poker. Pool. There. I said it and I didn’t shrivel up and die.</p>
<p>Satisfied? I don’t know what the big deal is. Rixon earns his</p>
<p>living the very same way.”</p>
<p>Vee shook her head. “You’re so in the dark, girl. You don’t buy</p>
<p>the kind of clothes Patch wears by winning bets at Bo’s Arcade.</p>
<p>”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? Patch wears jeans and T-shirts.</p>
<p>”</p>
<p>She put a hand on her hip. “You know how much jeans like</p>
<p>that run?”</p>
<p>“No,” I said, confused.</p>
<p>“Let’s just say you can’t buy jeans like that in Coldwater. He</p>
<p>probably ships them up from New York. Four hundred dollars a</p>
<p>pair.”</p>
<p>“You lie.”</p>
<p>“Cross my heart, hope to die. Last week, he was wearing a</p>
<p>Rolling Stones concert T-shirt with Mick Jagger’s autograph.</p>
<p>Rixon said it’s the real thing. Patch isn’t paying off his</p>
<p>MasterCard in poker chips. Back before you and Patch were</p>
<p>Splitsville, did you ever ask where he really gets his money? Or</p>
<p>how he got that nice shiny Jeep?”</p>
<p>“Patch won his Jeep off a poker game,” I argued. “If he won a</p>
<p>Jeep, I’m sure he could win enough to buy a pair of fourhundred-dollar</p>
<p>jeans. Maybe he’s just really good at poker.”</p>
<p>“Patch told you he won the Jeep. Rixon has a different story.”</p>
<p>I flipped my hair off my shoulders, trying to pretend like I</p>
<p>couldn’t care less about the direction our conversation was</p>
<p>headed, because Iwasn’t buying it. “Oh yeah? What’s that?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Rixon won’t say. All he said was, ‘Patch would</p>
<p>like you to think he won the Jeep. But he got his hands dirty</p>
<p>getting that car.’”</p>
<p>“Maybe you heard wrong.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, maybe,” Vee repeated cynically. “Or maybe Patch is a</p>
<p>damn lunatic running an illegal business.”</p>
<p>I handed her a tube of sunscreen, maybe just a little too hard.</p>
<p>“Put this on my back, and don’t miss any areas.”</p>
<p>“I think I’m going straight to oil,” Vee said, slapping</p>
<p>sunscreen across my back. “A little burn is better than spending</p>
<p>a whole day at the beach and leaving it as white as when you</p>
<p>came.”</p>
<p>I craned my neck over my shoulder but couldn’t tell how</p>
<p>thorough Vee’s job was. “Make sure you get under my straps.”</p>
<p>“Think they’d arrest me if I take off my top? I really hate tan</p>
<p>lines.”</p>
<p>I spread my towel under the umbrella and curled up beneath</p>
<p>its shade, rechecking to make sure my feet weren’t hanging out</p>
<p>in the sun. Vee shook her towel out a few feet away and</p>
<p>lathered her legs with baby oil. In the back of my mind, I</p>
<p>conjured up images of skin cancer I’d seen at the doctor’s</p>
<p>office.</p>
<p>“Speaking of Patch,” Vee said, “what’s the latest? Is he still</p>
<p>hooked up with Marcie?”</p>
<p>“Last I heard,” I said stiffly, thinking the only reason she’d</p>
<p>raised the question was to goad me further.</p>
<p>“Well, you know my opinion.”</p>
<p>I did, but I was going to hear it again, whether I wanted to or</p>
<p>not.</p>
<p>“The two of them deserve each other,” Vee said, spraying</p>
<p>Sun-In through her hair, misting the air with chemical lemon. “Of</p>
<p>course, I don’t think it will last. Patch will get bored and move</p>
<p>on. Just like he did with—”</p>
<p>“Can we talk about something other than Patch?” I cut in,</p>
<p>pinching my eyes closed and massaging the muscles at the</p>
<p>back of my neck.</p>
<p>“You sure you don’t want to talk? Looks like you’ve got a lot</p>
<p>“You sure you don’t want to talk? Looks like you’ve got a lot</p>
<p>on your mind.”</p>
<p>I rolled out a sigh. No use hiding it. Obnoxious or not, Vee</p>
<p>was my best friend and deserved the truth, when I could give it.</p>
<p>“He kissed me the other night.After the Devil’s Handbag.”</p>
<p>“He what?”</p>
<p>I pressed the heels of my hands into my eyes. “In my</p>
<p>bedroom.” I didn’t think I could explain to Vee that he’d kissed</p>
<p>me inside my dream. The point was, he had. Location was</p>
<p>irrelevant. That, and I didn’t want to even think about what it</p>
<p>meant that he now seemed capable of inserting himself into my</p>
<p>dreams.</p>
<p>“You let him inside?”</p>
<p>“Not exactly, but he came in anyway.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Vee said, looking like she was struggling to come up</p>
<p>with a decent response to my idiocy. “Here’s what we’ll do. We’re going to swear a blood oath. Don’t give me that look, I’m</p>
<p>serious. If we swear a blood oath, you’ll have to keep it or</p>
<p>something really bad will happen—like rats might gnaw off your</p>
<p>feet while you’re sleeping. And when you wake up, all that will</p>
<p>be left are bloody stumps. Do you have a pocketknife? We’ll</p>
<p>find a pocketknife, and then we’ll both cut our palms and press</p>
<p>them together. You’ll swear never to be alone with Patch again.</p>
<p>That way, if temptation strikes, you’ll have something to fall back</p>
<p>on.”</p>
<p>I wondered if I should tell her that being alone with Patch</p>
<p>wasn’t always my choice. He moved like vapor. If he wanted</p>
<p>alone time with me, he was going to get it.And though I hated to</p>
<p>admit it, I didn’t always mind.</p>
<p>“I need something a little more effective than a blood oath,” I</p>
<p>said.</p>
<p>“Babe, get a clue. This is serious stuff. I hope you’re a</p>
<p>believer, because I am. I’ll go hunt down a knife,” she said,</p>
<p>starting to rise to her feet.</p>
<p>I pulled her back down. “I have Marcie’s diary.”</p>
<p>“Wh-what?!” Vee sputtered.</p>
<p>“I took it, but I haven’t read it.”</p>
<p>“Why am I just now hearing about this? And what is taking</p>
<p>you so long to crack that baby open? Forget Rixon—let’s drive</p>
<p>home right now and read it! You know Marcie’s talked about</p>
<p>Patch in it.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“Then why the delay? Are you scared about what it might</p>
<p>reveal? Because I could read it first, filter out the bad stuff, and</p>
<p>just give you answers, straight up.”</p>
<p>“If Iread it, Imight never speak to Patch again.”</p>
<p>“That’s a good thing!”</p>
<p>I looked sideways at Vee. “I don’t know if it’s what Iwant.”</p>
<p>“Oh, babe. Don’t do this to yourself. It’s killing me. Read the</p>
<p>stupid diary and allow yourself closure. There are other guys out</p>
<p>there. Just so you know. There will never be a shortage of guys.”</p>
<p>“I know,” I said, but it felt like a cheap lie. There had never</p>
<p>been a guy before Patch. How could I tell myself there’d be one</p>
<p>after? “I’m not going to read the diary. I’m going to give it back.</p>
<p>Marcie and I have had this ridiculous feud for years, and it’s</p>
<p>getting old. I just want to move on.”</p>
<p>Vee’s jaw dropped, and she sputtered a little more. “Can’t</p>
<p>moving on wait until after you’ve read the diary? Or at least</p>
<p>given me a quick peek? Five minutes, that’s all I ask.”</p>
<p>“I’m taking the higher road.”</p>
<p>Vee rolled out her own sigh. “You’re not going to budge, are</p>
<p>you?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>A shadow fell over our towels.</p>
<p>“Mind if I join you lovely ladies?” We looked up to find Rixon standing over us in swim trunks</p>
<p>and a tank, with a towel thrown over his shoulder. He had a</p>
<p>gangly build that appeared surprisingly tough and resilient, a</p>
<p>hawk nose, and a shag of inky hair that fell across his forehead.</p>
<p>A pair of black angel wings was tattooed on his left shoulder,</p>
<p>and combined with a heavy five o’clock shadow, he looked like</p>
<p>he was employed by the mob. Charming, playful, and up to no</p>
<p>good.</p>
<p>“You made it!” Vee said, her smile lighting up her whole face.</p>
<p>Rixon collapsed on the sand in front of us, elbow down,</p>
<p>cheek propped on his fist. “What’d Imiss?”</p>
<p>“Vee wants me to swear a blood oath,” I said.</p>
<p>He cocked an eyebrow. “Sounds serious.”</p>
<p>“She thinks it will keep Patch out of my life.”</p>
<p>Rixon tilted his head back and laughed. “Good luck with that.”</p>
<p>“Hey now,” Vee said. “Blood oaths are serious stuff.”</p>
<p>Rixon laid his hand intimately on her thigh and grinned</p>
<p>affectionately at her, and I felt my chest ache with envy. Weeks</p>
<p>ago, Patch would have touched me the same way. The irony</p>
<p>was, weeks ago, Vee had probably felt the same way I did now</p>
<p>whenever she was forced to hang out with Patch and me.</p>
<p>Knowing this should have made swallowing my jealousy a little</p>
<p>bit easier, but the pain cut deep. Responding to Rixon, Vee</p>
<p>bent forward, placing a kiss on his mouth. I averted my eyes, but</p>
<p>it didn’t dilute the envy that seemed to hang like a rock in my</p>
<p>throat.</p>
<p>Rixon cleared his voice. “Why don’t I go buy us some</p>
<p>Cokes?” he asked, having the sensitivity to notice that he and</p>
<p>Vee were making me uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“Allow me,” Vee said, standing and dusting sand off her</p>
<p>bottom.</p>
<p>“I think Nora wants to talk to you, Rixon.” She made air</p>
<p>quotes around the word “talk.” “I’d stay, but I’m not a big fan of</p>
<p>the subject matter.”</p>
<p>“Uh—,” I began uncomfortably, not sure what Vee was hinting</p>
<p>at, but acutely aware that Iwasn’t going to like it.</p>
<p>Rixon smiled at me expectantly.</p>
<p>“Patch,” Vee said, clarifying things, only to make the air</p>
<p>seem ten times heavier than it already was. With that out of the</p>
<p>way, she marched off.</p>
<p>Rixon rubbed his chin. “You want to talk about Patch?”</p>
<p>“Not really. But you know Vee. Always there to make an</p>
<p>uncomfortable situation ten times worse,” I muttered under my</p>
<p>breath.</p>
<p>Rixon laughed. “Good thing I’m not easily humiliated.”</p>
<p>“Iwish I could say the same thing right now.”</p>
<p>“How are things?” he asked, trying to break the ice.</p>
<p>“With Patch, or in general?”</p>
<p>“Both.”</p>
<p>“They’ve been better.” Realizing there was a good chance</p>
<p>Rixon would pass anything I said along to Patch, I quickly</p>
<p>added, “I’m on the upswing. But can I ask a personal question?</p>
<p>It’s about Patch, but if you don’t feel comfortable answering, I’m</p>
<p>seriously okay with it.”</p>
<p>“Shoot.”</p>
<p>“Is he still my guardian angel? A while back, after a fight, I</p>
<p>told him I didn’t want him to be. But I’m not sure where we stand.</p>
<p>Is he no longer my guardian simply because I said that’s what I</p>
<p>wanted?”</p>
<p>“He’s still assigned to you.”</p>
<p>“How come he’s never around anymore?”</p>
<p>Rixon’s eyes glinted. “You broke up with him, remember? It’s</p>
<p>awkward for him. Most guys don’t relish the idea of hanging</p>
<p>around an ex any longer than they have to. That, and I know he</p>
<p>said the archangels are breathing down his neck. He’s bending</p>
<p>over backward to keep things strictly professional.”</p>
<p>“So he’s still protecting me?”</p>
<p>“Sure. Just from behind the scenes.”</p>
<p>“Who was in charge of matching him to me?”</p>
<p>Rixon shrugged. “The archangels.”</p>
<p>“Is there any way to let them know I’d like to be reassigned?</p>
<p>It’s not working out very well. Not since the breakup, anyway.”</p>
<p>It’s not working out very well. Not since the breakup, anyway.”</p>
<p>Not working out? It was tearing me up inside. All this touch and</p>
<p>go, seeing him, but not being able to have him, was</p>
<p>devastating.</p>
<p>He ran his thumb along his lip. “I can tell you what I know, but</p>
<p>there’s a good chance the information’s dated. It’s been a while</p>
<p>since Iwas in the loop. Ironically—you ready for this?—you have</p>
<p>to swear a blood oath.”</p>
<p>“Is this a joke?”</p>
<p>“You cut your palm and shake a few drops of blood into the</p>
<p>dust of the earth. Not carpet or concrete—dirt. Then you swear</p>
<p>the oath, acknowledging to heaven that you’re not afraid to shed</p>
<p>your own blood. From dust you came, and to dust you go. In</p>
<p>saying the oath, you give up your right to a guardian angel and</p>
<p>announce that you accept your fate—without heaven’s help.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, I’m not advocating it. They gave you a guardian,</p>
<p>and for good reason. Someone upstairs thinks you’re in danger.</p>
<p>I’m going with my gut on this one, but I think it’s more than a</p>
<p>paranoid hunch.”</p>
<p>Not exactly a news flash—I could feel something dark</p>
<p>pressing against my world, threatening to eclipse it. The</p>
<p>phantom behind my father’s reappearing ghost, most notably. I</p>
<p>was struck by a thought. “What if the person who’s after me is</p>
<p>also my guardian angel?” I asked slowly.</p>
<p>Rixon gave a yap of laughter. “Patch?” He didn’t sound like it</p>
<p>was even a possibility. No surprise there. Rixon had been</p>
<p>through everything with Patch. Even if Patch was guilty, Rixon</p>
<p>would stand by his side. Blind loyalty above all else.</p>
<p>“If he was trying to hurt me, would someone know?” I asked.</p>
<p>“The archangels? The angels of death? Dabria knew when</p>
<p>people were close to death. Could another angel of death stop</p>
<p>Patch before it’s too late?”</p>
<p>“If you’re doubting Patch, you’ve got the wrong guy.” His tone</p>
<p>had cooled. “I know him better than you. He takes his job as</p>
<p>guardian seriously.”</p>
<p>B ut if Patch wanted to kill me, he’d crafted the perfect</p>
<p>murder, hadn’t he? He was my guardian angel. He was charged</p>
<p>with keeping me safe. No one would suspect him….</p>
<p>But he’d already had his chance to kill me. And he hadn’t</p>
<p>taken it. He’d sacrificed the one thing he wanted most of all—a</p>
<p>human body—to save my life. He wouldn’t do that if he wanted</p>
<p>me dead. Would he?</p>
<p>I shook off my suspicions. Rixon was right. Suspecting Patch</p>
<p>was ridiculous at this point.</p>
<p>“Is he happy with Marcie?” I clamped my mouth shut. I hadn’t</p>
<p>meant to ask the question in the first place. It had spilled out in</p>
<p>the moment.A blush brushed my cheeks.</p>
<p>Rixon watched me, clearly giving his answer some thought.</p>
<p>“Patch is the closest thing I’ve got to family, and I love the guy</p>
<p>like a brother, but he’s not right for you. I know it, he knows it,</p>
<p>and deep down, I think you know it too. Maybe you don’t want to</p>
<p>hear this, but he and Marcie are alike. They’re cut from the</p>
<p>same cloth. Patch should be allowed to have a little fun. And he</p>
<p>can—Marcie doesn’t love him. Nothing she feels for him is</p>
<p>going to tip off the archangels.” We sat in silence, and I struggled to stuff my emotions deep</p>
<p>down. I’d tipped off the archangels, in other words. My feelings</p>
<p>for Patch were what exposed us. It was nothing Patch had done</p>
<p>or said. It was all me. According to Rixon’s explanation, Patch</p>
<p>had never loved me. He’d never reciprocated. I didn’t want to</p>
<p>accept it. I wanted Patch to have cared about me as much as I</p>
<p>cared about him. I didn’t want to think I’d been nothing more</p>
<p>than entertainment, a way to pass the time.</p>
<p>There was one more question I desperately wanted to ask</p>
<p>Rixon. If Patch and I were still on good terms, I would have</p>
<p>asked him, but that was a moot point now. Rixon was just as</p>
<p>worldly as Patch, however. He knew things other people didn’t —particularly when it came to fallen angels and Nephilim—and</p>
<p>what he didn’t know, he could find out. Right now, my best hope</p>
<p>at finding the Black Hand was through Rixon.</p>
<p>I moistened my lips and decided to get the question over</p>
<p>with. “Have you ever heard of the Black Hand?”</p>
<p>Rixon flinched. He studied me in silence a moment before</p>
<p>his face blazed with amusement. “Is this a joke? I haven’t heard</p>
<p>that name in a long time. I thought Patch didn’t like to be called</p>
<p>it. Did he tell you about it, then?”</p>
<p>A slow freeze gripped my heart. I’d been on the brink of</p>
<p>telling Rixon about the envelope with the iron ring and note</p>
<p>claiming the Black Hand killed my father, but found myself</p>
<p>grasping for a new response. “The Black Hand is Patch’s</p>
<p>nickname?”</p>
<p>“He hasn’t gone by it in years. Not since I started calling him</p>
<p>“He hasn’t gone by it in years. Not since I started calling him</p>
<p>Patch. He never liked the Black Hand.” He scratched his cheek.</p>
<p>“Those were back in the days when we took jobs as</p>
<p>mercenaries for the French king. Eighteenth-century black ops.</p>
<p>Enjoyable stint. Good money.”</p>
<p>I might as well have been slapped across the face. The</p>
<p>whole moment felt unbalanced, tipped on its side. Rixon’s</p>
<p>words ran over me in a blur, as if he was speaking in a foreign</p>
<p>language, and I couldn’t keep up. I was immediately</p>
<p>bombarded with doubts. Not Patch. He hadn’t killed my dad.</p>
<p>Anyone else, but not him.</p>
<p>Slowly the doubts began to fall by the wayside, replaced by</p>
<p>other thoughts. I found myself picking through facts, analyzing</p>
<p>for evidence. The night I gave Patch my ring: The moment I’d</p>
<p>said my dad had given it to me, he insisted he couldn’t take it,</p>
<p>almost adamantly so. And the mere name the Black Hand. It</p>
<p>was fitting, almost too fitting. Forcing myself to hang on a few</p>
<p>more moments, holding my emotions carefully in check, I</p>
<p>selected my next words carefully.</p>
<p>“You know what I regret most?” I said, my tone as casual as I</p>
<p>could make it. “It’s the stupidest thing, and you’ll probably</p>
<p>laugh.” To make my story convincing, I pulled a trivial laugh up</p>
<p>from someplace deep inside me that I didn’t even know existed.</p>
<p>“I left my favorite sweatshirt at his house. It’s from Oxford—my</p>
<p>dream school,” I explained. “My dad picked it up for me when</p>
<p>he went to England, so it means a lot.”</p>
<p>“You were at Patch’s place?” He sounded genuinely</p>
<p>surprised.</p>
<p>“Just once. My mom was home, so we drove over to his</p>
<p>place to watch a movie. I left my sweatshirt on the sofa.” I knew I</p>
<p>was walking a dangerous line—the more details I revealed</p>
<p>about Patch’s house, the higher the chance something wouldn’t</p>
<p>match up, and my cover would be blown. But along the same</p>
<p>lines, if I was too vague, I was scared it would tip Rixon off that I</p>
<p>was lying.</p>
<p>“I’m impressed. He likes to keep his home address off the</p>
<p>radar.”</p>
<p>And why was that? I wondered. What was he hiding? Why</p>
<p>was Rixon the only person allowed into Patch’s inner sanctum?</p>
<p>What could he share with Rixon, but no one else? Had he never</p>
<p>allowed me inside because he knew something I’d see there</p>
<p>would unravel the truth—that he was responsible for murdering</p>
<p>my dad?</p>
<p>“Getting the sweatshirt back would mean a lot to me,” I said. I</p>
<p>felt somehow removed, as if I was watching myself converse</p>
<p>with Rixon from several feet away. Someone stronger, more</p>
<p>clever and contained was saying the words rolling from my</p>
<p>mouth. I was not that person. I was the girl who felt herself</p>
<p>crumbling into pieces as fine as the sand beneath her feet.</p>
<p>“Head over first thing in the morning. Patch leaves early, but if</p>
<p>you’re there by six thirty, you should catch him.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to have to do it face-to-face.”</p>
<p>“Want me to pick up the sweatshirt next time I’m over? I’m</p>
<p>sure I’ll be over there tomorrow night. This weekend at the</p>
<p>latest.”</p>
<p>“I’d like to get it sooner rather than later. My mom keeps</p>
<p>“I’d like to get it sooner rather than later. My mom keeps</p>
<p>asking about it. Patch gave me a key, and as long as he hasn’t</p>
<p>changed the locks, I could still get in. Trouble is, it was dark</p>
<p>when we drove over, and I don’t remember how to get to his</p>
<p>place. I didn’t pay attention, because I wasn’t planning on</p>
<p>having to drive back and get my sweatshirt, post-breakup.”</p>
<p>“Swathmore. Near the industrial district.”</p>
<p>My mind netted this information.</p>
<p>If his place was near the industrial district, I was betting he</p>
<p>lived in one of the brick apartment buildings on the edge of Old</p>
<p>Town Coldwater. There wasn’t much else to choose from,</p>
<p>unless he’d taken up residence in one of the abandoned</p>
<p>factories or vagabond shacks by the river, which seemed</p>
<p>doubtful.</p>
<p>I smiled, hoping I appeared relaxed. “I knew it was over by</p>
<p>the river somewhere. Top floor, right?” I said, taking a stab in the</p>
<p>dark. It seemed to me Patch wouldn’t want to hear his</p>
<p>neighbors stomping around above him.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Rixon said. “Number thirty-four.”</p>
<p>“Do you think Patch will be home tonight? I don’t want to</p>
<p>bump into him. Especially if he’s there with Marcie. I just want to</p>
<p>get the sweatshirt and get out.”</p>
<p>Rixon coughed into his fist. “Uh, no, you should be good.” He</p>
<p>scratched his cheek and cast me a nervous, almost pitying,</p>
<p>look. “Vee and I are actually meeting up with Patch and Marcie</p>
<p>for a movie tonight.”</p>
<p>I felt my spine stiffen. The air in my lungs seem to shatter …</p>
<p>and then, just when I felt all semblance of my carefully controlled</p>
<p>emotions fleeing, I was speaking clearly again. I had to. “Does</p>
<p>Vee know?”</p>
<p>“I’m still trying to figure out how to break the news.”</p>
<p>“Break the news about what?”</p>
<p>Rixon and I both swung around as Vee plopped down with a</p>
<p>cardboard crate of Cokes.</p>
<p>“Uh—a surprise,” Rixon said. “I’ve got something planned for</p>
<p>tonight.”</p>
<p>Vee grinned. “A clue, a clue! Pleeeease?”</p>
<p>Rixon and I shared a quick glance, but I looked away. I didn’t</p>
<p>want any part of this. Besides, I’d already tuned out. My</p>
<p>thoughts were robotically sifting through this new information:</p>
<p>Tonight. Patch and Marcie. A date. Patch’s apartment would be</p>
<p>empty.</p>
<p>I had to get in.</p><p>

<p></p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>THREE HOURS LATER, THE FRONTS OF VEE’S THIGHS were toasted</p>
<p>red, the tops of her feet were blistered, and her face was</p>
<p>swollen with heat. Rixon had taken off an hour ago, and Vee</p>
<p>and I were lugging the umbrella and beach tote up the alley</p>
<p>branching off Old Orchard Street.</p>
<p>“I feel funny,” Vee said. “Like I’m going to pass out. Maybe I</p>
<p>should have gone easy on the baby oil.”</p>
<p>I was lightheaded and uncomfortably warm too, but it didn’t</p>
<p>have anything to do with the weather. A headache sliced down</p>
<p>the center of my skull. I kept trying to swallow the bad taste in</p>
<p>my mouth, but the more I swallowed, the queasier my stomach</p>
<p>grew. The name “the Black Hand” skipped around my mind like</p>
<p>it was taunting me to give it my full attention, stabbing its nails</p>
<p>into my headache every time I tried to ignore it. I couldn’t think</p>
<p>about it now, in front of Vee, having enough foresight to know I’d</p>
<p>shatter the moment I did. I had to juggle the pain a little longer,</p>
<p>tossing it up in the air every time it threatened to crash down. I</p>
<p>clung to the safety of numb devastation, pushing the inevitable</p>
<p>off as long as I could. Patch. The Black Hand. It couldn’t be.</p>
<p>Vee came to a halt. “What is that?” We were standing in the parking lot at the rear of the</p>
<p>bookstore, a few feet from the Neon, and we were staring at the</p>
<p>large piece of metal attached to the left rear tire.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a car boot,” I said.</p>
<p>“I can see that. What’s it doing on my car?”</p>
<p>“I guess when they say violators will be towed, they mean it.”</p>
<p>“Don’t get smart with me. What are we going to do now?”</p>
<p>“Call Rixon?” I suggested.</p>
<p>“He’s not going to be very happy about having to drive all the</p>
<p>way back out here. What about your mom? Is she back in town?</p>
<p>”</p>
<p>“Not yet. How about your parents?”</p>
<p>Vee sat on the curb and buried her face in her hands. “It</p>
<p>probably costs a fortune to get a car boot removed. This will be</p>
<p>the last straw. My mom’s going to ship me off to a monastery.”</p>
<p>I took a seat beside her, and together we pondered our</p>
<p>options.</p>
<p>“Don’t we have any other friends?” Vee asked. “Someone</p>
<p>we could call for a ride without feeling too guilty? I wouldn’t feel</p>
<p>guilty about making Marcie drive all the way out here, but I’m</p>
<p>pretty sure she wouldn’t do it. Not for us. Especially not for us.</p>
<p>You’re friends with Scott. Think he’d come get us? Hold on a</p>
<p>minute … isn’t that Patch’s Jeep?”</p>
<p>I followed Vee’s gaze down the opposite end of the alley. It</p>
<p>fed into Imperial Street, and sure enough, parked on the far</p>
<p>side of Imperial was a shiny black Jeep Commander. The</p>
<p>windows were tinted, a glare of sun reflecting off them.</p>
<p>My heart accelerated. I couldn’t run into Patch. Not here. Not</p>
<p>yet. Not when the only thing keeping me from breaking down</p>
<p>sobbing was a carefully constructed dam whose foundation</p>
<p>cracked deeper with every passing second.</p>
<p>“He must be here somewhere,” Vee said. “Text him and tell</p>
<p>him we’re stranded. I might not like him, but I’ll use him if it gets</p>
<p>me a ride home.”</p>
<p>“I’d text Marcie before I’d text Patch.” I hoped Vee didn’t</p>
<p>detect the strange, dull note of distress and loathing in my</p>
<p>voice. The Black Hand … the Black Hand … not Patch …</p>
<p>please, not Patch … a mistake, an explanation … The</p>
<p>headache seared, as if my own body was warning me to stop</p>
<p>this line of thinking for my own safety.</p>
<p>“Who else can we call?” Vee said. We both knew who we could call. Absolutely no one. We</p>
<p>were lame, friendless people. No one owed us a favor. The only</p>
<p>person who would drop everything to come to my rescue was</p>
<p>sitting beside me.And vice versa.</p>
<p>I directed my attention back to the Jeep. For no reason</p>
<p>whatsoever, I stood. “I’m driving the Jeep home.” I wasn’t sure</p>
<p>what kind of statement I intended to send to Patch. An eye for</p>
<p>an eye? You hurt me, I’ll hurt you? Or maybe, This is only the</p>
<p>start, if you had anything to do with my dad’s death …</p>
<p>“Is Patch going to be mad when he figures out you stole his</p>
<p>Jeep?” Vee said.</p>
<p>“I don’t care. I’m not going to sit here all evening.”</p>
<p>“I have a bad feeling about this,” Vee said. “I don’t like Patch</p>
<p>on a normal day, never mind when he’s got his temper on.”</p>
<p>“What happened to your sense of adventure?” A fierce</p>
<p>desire had taken control of me, and I wanted nothing more than</p>
<p>to take the Jeep and send Patch a message. I envisioned</p>
<p>bumping the Jeep into a tree. Not hard enough to deploy the air</p>
<p>bags, just hard enough to leave a dent. A little memento from</p>
<p>me.A warning.</p>
<p>“My sense of adventure stops short of a kamikaze suicide</p>
<p>mission,” said Vee. “It’s not going to be pretty when he figures</p>
<p>out it was you.”</p>
<p>The logical voice in my head might have instructed me to</p>
<p>back away for a moment, but all logic had left me. If he’d hurt my</p>
<p>family, if he’d destroyed my family, if he’d lied to me—</p>
<p>“Do you even know how to boost a car?” Vee asked.</p>
<p>“Patch taught me.”</p>
<p>She didn’t look convinced. “You mean you saw Patch steal a</p>
<p>car, and now you think you’ll give it a try?”</p>
<p>I strode down the alley toward Imperial Street, with Vee</p>
<p>jogging close behind. I checked for traffic, then crossed to the</p>
<p>Jeep. I tried the door latch. Locked.</p>
<p>“Nobody’s home,” Vee said, cupping her hands around her</p>
<p>eyes to peer inside. “I think we should walk away. Come on,</p>
<p>Nora. Back away from the Jeep.”</p>
<p>“We need a ride. We’re stranded.”</p>
<p>“We still have two legs, leftie and rightie. Mine are in the</p>
<p>mood for exercise. They feel like a nice long walk—Are you</p>
<p>crazy?” she shrieked.</p>
<p>Iwas standing with the tip of the beach umbrella aimed at the</p>
<p>driver’s-side window. “What?” I said. “We have to get in.”</p>
<p>“Put the umbrella down! You’re going to draw a lot of</p>
<p>negative attention if you smash out the window. What’s gotten</p>
<p>into you?” she said, watching me, wild-eyed.</p>
<p>A vision flashed across my mind. I saw Patch standing over</p>
<p>my dad, gun in hand. The sound of a shot ripped the silence.</p>
<p>I braced my hands on my knees and leaned over, feeling</p>
<p>tears sting behind my eyes. The ground lurched into a</p>
<p>nauseating spin. Sweat curved trails down the sides of my face.</p>
<p>I was being smothered, as if all oxygen had suddenly</p>
<p>evaporated from the air. The more I tried to draw air, the more</p>
<p>paralyzed my lungs became. Vee was shouting at me, but it</p>
<p>came from far away, an underwater sound.</p>
<p>All of a sudden the ground halted. I took three sharp breaths.</p>
<p>Vee was ordering me to sit, yelling something about heat</p>
<p>exhaustion. I pulled free from her grip.</p>
<p>“I’m okay,” I said, holding up a hand when she came for me</p>
<p>again. “I’m okay.”</p>
<p>To show her I was fine, I bent to pick up my tote, which I must</p>
<p>have dropped, and it was then that I saw the spare key to the</p>
<p>Jeep gleaming gold in the bottom. The one I’d stolen from</p>
<p>Marcie’s bedroom the night of her party.</p>
<p>“I have a key to the Jeep,” I said, the words surprising even</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>A frown mark stretched across Vee’s forehead. “Patch never</p>
<p>asked for it back?”</p>
<p>“He never gave it to me. I found it in Marcie’s room Tuesday</p>
<p>night.”</p>
<p>night.”</p>
<p>“Whoa.”</p>
<p>I shoved the key in the lock, climbed in, and sat in the driver’s</p>
<p>seat. Then I adjusted the seat forward, cranked the ignition, and</p>
<p>gripped the steering wheel with both hands. Despite the heat,</p>
<p>my hands were cold and jittery.</p>
<p>“You’re not thinking about doing more damage than just</p>
<p>driving this thing home, are you?” Vee asked, buckling herself</p>
<p>into shotgun. “Because the vein in your temple is throbbing, and</p>
<p>the last time I saw it do that was right before you clipped Marcie</p>
<p>in the jaw at the Devil’s Handbag.”</p>
<p>I licked my lips, which felt sandpapery and rubbery at the</p>
<p>same time. “He gave Marcie a spare to the Jeep—I should park</p>
<p>this thing in the ocean, twenty feet under.”</p>
<p>“Maybe he had a really good reason,” Vee said nervously.</p>
<p>I gave a high slight laugh. “I won’t do anything to it until after I</p>
<p>drop you off.” I cranked the wheel to the left and peeled onto the</p>
<p>street.</p>
<p>“You swear to add that disclaimer when you try explaining to</p>
<p>Patch why you stole his Jeep?”</p>
<p>“I’m not stealing it. We’re stranded. This is called borrowing.”</p>
<p>“This is called you’re crazy.” I could feel Vee’s bewilderment</p>
<p>at my anger. I could see irrational in the way she stared at me.</p>
<p>Maybe I was irrational. Maybe I’d pushed things over the edge.</p>
<p>Two people can have the same nickname, I thought, trying to</p>
<p>convince myself. They could. They could, they could, they</p>
<p>could. I hoped the more I said it, the more I’d come to believe it,</p>
<p>but the place that Ireserved in my heart for trust felt hollow.</p>
<p>“Let’s get out of here,” Vee said, using a wary, frightened</p>
<p>voice she never used with me. “We have lemonade at my place.</p>
<p>After that we could watch TV. Maybe take a nap. Don’t you have</p>
<p>to work tonight?”</p>
<p>I was about to tell her that Roberta hadn’t scheduled me</p>
<p>tonight, when I tapped the brake. “What’s that?”</p>
<p>Vee followed my gaze. She bent forward, pulling a scrap of</p>
<p>pink fabric off the dash. She dangled the French bikini top</p>
<p>between us. We looked at each other, and we were both thinking the</p>
<p>same thing.</p>
<p>Marcie.</p>
<p>No doubt about it, she was here with Patch. Right now. On</p>
<p>the beach. Lying on the sand. Doing who knows what else.</p>
<p>A violent, traitorous surge of hate spiked through me. I hated</p>
<p>him. And I hated myself for adding my name to the list of girls</p>
<p>he’d seduced, then betrayed. A raw desire to rectify my</p>
<p>ignorance gripped me. I wasn’t going to be just another girl. He</p>
<p>couldn’t make me disappear. If he was the Black Hand, I would</p>
<p>find out. And if he’d had anything to do with my dad’s death, I</p>
<p>would make him pay.</p>
<p>“He can find his own ride home,” I said through a quivering</p>
<p>jaw. I punched the gas, laying down a stretch of rubber on the</p>
<p>street.</p>
<p>Hours later, I stood in front of the fridge, door open, surveying</p>
<p>the contents, looking for something that could pass as dinner.</p>
<p>When nothing popped out at me, I moved to the narrow pantry</p>
<p>kitty-corner to the fridge and did the same thing. I settled on a</p>
<p>box of bow-tie pasta and a jar of sausage spaghetti sauce. When the stove timer beeped, I drained the pasta, poured</p>
<p>myself a bowl, and stuck the sauce in the microwave. We were</p>
<p>out of Parmesan, so I grated cheddar and called it good. The</p>
<p>microwave chimed, and I spooned layers of sauce and cheese</p>
<p>on top of the pasta. As I turned to carry everything to the table, I</p>
<p>found Patch leaning against it. The bowl of pasta nearly slipped</p>
<p>through my fingers.</p>
<p>“How did you get in?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Might want to keep the door locked. Especially when you’re</p>
<p>home alone.”</p>
<p>His stance was relaxed, but his eyes were not. The color of</p>
<p>black marble, they cut right through me. I had no doubt he knew</p>
<p>I’d stolen the Jeep. Hard not to, since it was parked in the</p>
<p>driveway. There were only so many places to hide a Jeep at a</p>
<p>house surrounded by open fields on one side, and</p>
<p>impenetrable woodlands on the other. I hadn’t been thinking</p>
<p>about hiding when I’d pulled the Jeep into the driveway; I’d been</p>
<p>consumed by sickening abhorrence and shock. Everything had</p>
<p>come into sharp focus: his smooth words, his black, glinting</p>
<p>eyes, his broad experience with lies, seduction, women. I’d</p>
<p>fallen in love with the devil.</p>
<p>“You took the Jeep,” Patch said. Calm but not happy.</p>
<p>“Vee parked in an illegal zone and they put a boot on her car. We had to get home, and that’s when we saw the Jeep across</p>
<p>the street.” My palms touched with sweat, but I didn’t dare wipe</p>
<p>the street.” My palms touched with sweat, but I didn’t dare wipe</p>
<p>them dry. Not in front of Patch. He looked different tonight. More</p>
<p>severe, hardened. The wan glow of the kitchen lights traced the</p>
<p>cut of his cheekbones, and his black hair, tousled from a day at</p>
<p>the beach, hung low across his forehead, nearly touching his</p>
<p>obscenely long eyelashes. His mouth, which I’d always thought</p>
<p>of as sensual, was turned up cynically on one side. It wasn’t a</p>
<p>warm smile.</p>
<p>“You couldn’t call and give me a heads-up?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I didn’t have my phone.”</p>
<p>“And Vee?”</p>
<p>“She doesn’t have your number on her phone. And I couldn’t</p>
<p>remember your new number anyway. We didn’t have a way to</p>
<p>reach you.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have a key to the Jeep. How’d you get in?”</p>
<p>It was all I could do not to give him a traitorous look. “Your</p>
<p>spare.”</p>
<p>I saw him trying to calculate where I was going with this. We</p>
<p>both knew he’d never given me a spare. I watched him closely</p>
<p>for any sign that he knew I was referring to Marcie’s key, but the</p>
<p>light of understanding never lit his eyes. Everything about him</p>
<p>was controlled, impenetrable, unreadable.</p>
<p>“Which spare?” he asked.</p>
<p>This only made me angrier, because I’d expected him to</p>
<p>know exactly which key I was talking about. How many spares</p>
<p>did he have? How many other girls had a key to the Jeep</p>
<p>stowed in their purses? “Your girlfriend,” I said. “Or is that not</p>
<p>enough of a clarification?”</p>
<p>“Let me see if I’ve got this. You stole the Jeep to get back at</p>
<p>me for giving a spare to Marcie?”</p>
<p>“I stole the Jeep because Vee and I needed it,” I said coolly.</p>
<p>“There was a time when you were always there when I needed</p>
<p>you. I thought maybe that was still true, but apparently I was</p>
<p>wrong.”</p>
<p>Patch’s eyes didn’t waver from mine. “Want to tell me what</p>
<p>this is really about?” When I didn’t answer, he dragged out one</p>
<p>of the kitchen chairs tucked under the table. He sat, arms</p>
<p>crossed, legs stretched out languidly. “I’ve got time.”</p>
<p>The Black Hand. That’s what this was really about. But I was</p>
<p>scared to confront him. Because of what I might learn, and how</p>
<p>he might react. I felt sure that he had absolutely no idea how</p>
<p>much I knew. If I accused him of being the Black Hand, there</p>
<p>was no turning back. I would have to face the truth that held the</p>
<p>power to break me down to my very soul.</p>
<p>Patch raised his eyebrows. “Silent treatment?”</p>
<p>“This is about telling the truth,” I said. “Something you’ve</p>
<p>never done.” If he’d killed my dad, how could he have looked</p>
<p>me in the eye all those times, telling me how sorry he was, and</p>
<p>never told me the truth? How could he kiss me, caress me, hold</p>
<p>me in his arms, and live with himself?</p>
<p>“Something I’ve never done? From the day we met, I never</p>
<p>lied to you. You didn’t always like what I had to say, but I was</p>
<p>always up-front.”</p>
<p>“You let me believe you loved me.A lie!”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry it felt like a lie.” He wasn’t sorry. There was a look</p>
<p>of stony fury in his gaze. He hated that I was calling him out. He</p>
<p>of stony fury in his gaze. He hated that I was calling him out. He</p>
<p>wanted me to be like all the other girls and disappear into his</p>
<p>past without so much as a peep.</p>
<p>“If you felt anything for me, you wouldn’t have moved on to</p>
<p>Marcie in record time.”</p>
<p>“And you didn’t move on to Scott in record time? You’d rather</p>
<p>have half a man than me?”</p>
<p>“Half a man? Scott is a person.”</p>
<p>“He’s Nephilim.” He made a careless gesture in the direction</p>
<p>of the front door. “The Jeep has more value.”</p>
<p>“Maybe he feels the same way about angels.”</p>
<p>He shrugged, lazy and arrogant. “I doubt it. If it weren’t for us,</p>
<p>his race wouldn’t exist.”</p>
<p>“Frankenstein’s monster didn’t love him.”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“The Nephilim race is already seeking revenge on angels.</p>
<p>Maybe this is only the beginning.”</p>
<p>Patch raised his ball cap and dragged a hand through his</p>
<p>hair. From the look on his face, I got the impression that the</p>
<p>situation was far more dangerous than I’d originally been led to</p>
<p>believe. How close was the Nephilim race to overpowering</p>
<p>fallen angels? Surely not by this Cheshvan. Patch couldn’t mean</p>
<p>that in less than five months, swarms of fallen angels would</p>
<p>invade, and eventually kill, tens of thousands of humans. But</p>
<p>everything in the way he held himself, down to the very look in</p>
<p>his eye, told me that was exactly what was in store.</p>
<p>“What are you doing about it?” I asked, horrified.</p>
<p>He picked up the glass of water I’d poured for myself and left</p>
<p>on the table, and took a drink. “I’ve been told to stay out of it.”</p>
<p>“By the archangels?”</p>
<p>“The Nephilim race is evil. They were never supposed to</p>
<p>inhabit Earth. They exist because of the pride of fallen angels.</p>
<p>The archangels want nothing to do with them. They’re not going</p>
<p>to step in where Nephilim are concerned.”</p>
<p>“And all the humans who will die?”</p>
<p>“The archangels have their own plan. Sometimes bad things</p>
<p>have to happen before good things can.”</p>
<p>“Plan? What plan? To watch innocent people die?”</p>
<p>“The Nephilim are walking straight into a trap of their own</p>
<p>making. If people have to die to annihilate the Nephilim race,</p>
<p>the archangels will risk it.”</p>
<p>The hairs on my scalp prickled. “And you agree with them?”</p>
<p>“I’m a guardian angel now. My allegiance is to the</p>
<p>archangels.” A blaze of killing hate rose in his eyes, and for one</p>
<p>brief moment, I believed it was directed at me. As if he blamed</p>
<p>me for what he’d become. In my defense, I felt a wash of anger.</p>
<p>Had he forgotten everything from that night? I’d sacrificed my</p>
<p>life for him, and he rejected it. If he wanted to blame someone</p>
<p>for his circumstances, it wasn’t me!</p>
<p>“How strong are the Nephilim?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Strong enough.” His voice was disturbingly devoid of</p>
<p>concern.</p>
<p>“They could hold off the fallen angels as early as this</p>
<p>Cheshvan, couldn’t they?”</p>
<p>He gave a nod.</p>
<p>I hugged myself to ward off a deep, sudden chill, but it was</p>
<p>I hugged myself to ward off a deep, sudden chill, but it was</p>
<p>more psychological than physical. “You have to do something.”</p>
<p>He shut his eyes.</p>
<p>“If fallen angels can’t possess Nephilim, they’ll move on to</p>
<p>humans,” I said, trying to break through his hands-off attitude</p>
<p>and reach his conscience. “That’s what you said. Tens of</p>
<p>thousands of humans. Maybe Vee. My mom. Maybe me.”</p>
<p>He still said nothing.</p>
<p>“Don’t you even care?”</p>
<p>His eyes flicked to his watch, and he pushed up from the</p>
<p>table. “I hate to rush out of here when we’ve got unfinished</p>
<p>business, but I’m late.” The spare key to the Jeep was lying in a</p>
<p>dish on the sideboard, and he pocketed it. “Thanks for the key.</p>
<p>I’ll add borrowing the Jeep to your tab.”</p>
<p>I parked myself between him and the door. “My tab?”</p>
<p>“I got you home from the Z, got you off Marcie’s roof, and now</p>
<p>I let you use my Jeep. I don’t give out favors for free.”</p>
<p>I was pretty sure he wasn’t joking. In fact, I was pretty sure he</p>
<p>was dead serious.</p>
<p>“We can work it so you pay me after each individual favor,</p>
<p>but I figured a tab would be easier.” His smile was a taunting</p>
<p>curve. First-class-jerk smug.</p>
<p>I narrowed my eyes. “You’re actually enjoying this, aren’t you?</p>
<p>”</p>
<p>“One of these days I’m going to come to collect on the favors,</p>
<p>and then I’ll really be enjoying it.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t loan me the Jeep,” I argued. “I stole it. And it</p>
<p>wasn’t a favor—I commandeered it.”</p>
<p>He gave his watch a second glance. “We’re going to have to</p>
<p>finish this later. I’ve got to run.”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” I snapped. “A movie with Marcie. Go have fun</p>
<p>while my world hangs in the balance.” I told myself I wanted him</p>
<p>to go. He deserved Marcie. I didn’t care. I was tempted to hurl</p>
<p>something after him; I thought about slamming the door at his</p>
<p>back. But I wasn’t going to let him go without asking the</p>
<p>question that burned my every thought. I dug my teeth into the</p>
<p>inside of my cheek to keep my voice from unraveling. “Do you</p>
<p>know who killed my dad?” My voice was cold and controlled,</p>
<p>and not my own. It was the voice of someone who was filled to</p>
<p>the very tips of her fingers with hate, devastation, accusation.</p>
<p>Patch stopped with his back to me.</p>
<p>“What happened that night?” I didn’t bother trying to hide the</p>
<p>desperation in my voice.</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, he said, “You’re asking me like</p>
<p>you think Imight know.”</p>
<p>“I know you’re the Black Hand.” I shut my eyes briefly, feeling</p>
<p>my whole body sway under a wave of nausea.</p>
<p>He looked over his shoulder. “Who told you that?”</p>
<p>“Then it’s true?” I realized my hands were balled into fists at</p>
<p>my sides, shaking violently. “You’re the Black Hand.” I watched</p>
<p>his face, praying he’d somehow refute it.</p>
<p>The grandfather clock in the hall chimed the hour, a heavy,</p>
<p>reverberating sound.</p>
<p>“Get out,” I said. I wouldn’t cry in front of him. I refused to. I</p>
<p>wouldn’t give him that satisfaction.</p>
<p>He stood in place, his face cold with shadow, mildly satanic.</p>
<p>He stood in place, his face cold with shadow, mildly satanic.</p>
<p>The clock counted through the silence. One, two, three.</p>
<p>“I’ll make you pay for it,” I said, my voice still oddly foreign.</p>
<p>Four, five.</p>
<p>“I’ll find a way. You deserve to go to hell. The only thing that</p>
<p>could make me sorry is if the archangels beat me to it.”</p>
<p>A flash of hot black crossed his eyes.</p>
<p>“You deserve everything that’s coming to you,” I told him.</p>
<p>“Every time you kissed me and held me, knowing what you did</p>
<p>to my dad—” I choked and turned away, falling apart when I</p>
<p>could least afford it.</p>
<p>Six.</p>
<p>“Go away,” I said, my voice quiet, but not steady.</p>
<p>I looked up, glaring, intending to make Patch leave with the</p>
<p>intensity of hate and loathing in my eyes, but I was alone in the</p>
<p>hall. I glanced around, expecting him to have stepped out of my</p>
<p>view, but he wasn’t there. A strange silence settled in between</p>
<p>the shadows, and I realized the grandfather clock had stopped</p>
<p>beating.</p>
<p>Its hands were frozen on the six and twelve, having stopped</p>
<p>the moment Patch left for good.</p><p>

<p></p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>AFTER PATCH LEFT, I TRADED OUT MYBEACH cover-up for dark jeans</p>
<p>and a tee, and zipped myself into a black Razorbills</p>
<p>windbreaker I’d won at last year’s eZine Christmas party. Even</p>
<p>though the thought made my stomach swim uneasily, I had to</p>
<p>look through Patch’s apartment, and I had to do it tonight —before it was too late.</p>
<p>It had been stupid to tell Patch I knew he was the Black</p>
<p>Hand. It had come out in a moment of hostile recklessness. I’d</p>
<p>lost my advantage of surprise. I doubted he saw me as a real</p>
<p>threat—he probably found my promise to send him to hell darkly</p>
<p>amusing— but I had information he’d clearly worked very hard</p>
<p>to keep concealed. Based on everything I knew about the allknowing,</p>
<p>ever-watchful archangels, it hadn’t been easy keeping</p>
<p>his involvement in my dad’s murder from them. I couldn’t send</p>
<p>him to hell, but the archangels could. If I found a way to contact</p>
<p>them, his carefully crafted secret would be blown open. The</p>
<p>archangels were hunting for an excuse to banish him to hell. Well, I had a reason.</p>
<p>My eyes watered, and I blinked the tears hastily away. There</p>
<p>was a time in my life when I never would have believed Patch</p>
<p>capable of killing my dad. The idea would have been laughable,</p>
<p>preposterous—offensive. But it only showed how cleverly and</p>
<p>thoroughly he’d deceived me.</p>
<p>Everything told me the apartment on Swathmore was where</p>
<p>he kept his secrets. It was his one vulnerability. Aside from</p>
<p>Rixon, no one was allowed inside. Earlier today, when I’d</p>
<p>mentioned to Rixon that I’d been there, he’d answered with</p>
<p>genuine surprise. He likes to keep his home address off the</p>
<p>radar, he’d said. Had Patch managed to keep it off the</p>
<p>archangels’ radar? It seemed highly unlikely, bordering on</p>
<p>impossible, but Patch had proven that he was very good at</p>
<p>finding a way around any obstacle placed in his path. If anyone</p>
<p>was resourceful or clever enough to undermine the archangels,</p>
<p>it was Patch. I shuddered unexpectedly as I wondered what he</p>
<p>was keeping in his apartment. An ominous feeling that tickled</p>
<p>my spine seemed to warn me not to go, but I owed it to my dad</p>
<p>to bring his killer to justice.</p>
<p>I located a flashlight under my bed and zipped it inside the</p>
<p>front pouch of the Windbreaker. As I was getting to my feet,</p>
<p>Marcie’s diary caught my eye. It was resting across a row of</p>
<p>books on my bookshelf. I debated a moment, feeling a hole</p>
<p>burn in my conscience. With a sigh, I tucked the diary alongside</p>
<p>the flashlight, locked up behind me, and set out on foot.</p>
<p>I walked the mile stretch to Beech, then caught a bus to</p>
<p>Herring Street. I walked three blocks to Keate, hopped on</p>
<p>another bus to Clementine, then walked on foot up the winding,</p>
<p>scenic hill leading into Marcie’s neighborhood, which was about</p>
<p>as close to posh as Coldwater came. The smell of fresh-cut</p>
<p>grass and hydrangeas hung in the evening air, and traffic was</p>
<p>nonexistent. Cars were kept neatly tucked away in the garages,</p>
<p>making the streets seem wider, cleaner. The windows of the</p>
<p>white colonial houses reflected the blaze of the slow-setting sun,</p>
<p>and I imagined families sitting down together for a late dinner</p>
<p>behind the shutters. I bit my lip, startled by a sudden rush of</p>
<p>inconsolable regret. My family would never sit down together for</p>
<p>a meal again. Three nights a week I ate dinner alone, or at</p>
<p>Vee’s. The other four nights, when my mom was home, we</p>
<p>typically ate on trays in front of the TV.</p>
<p>Because of Patch.</p>
<p>I turned onto Brenchley, counting down houses to Marcie’s.</p>
<p>Her red Toyota 4-Runner was parked in the drive, but I knew she</p>
<p>wasn’t home. Patch would have picked her up for the movie in</p>
<p>the Jeep. I was cutting across the lawn, thinking I would leave</p>
<p>the diary on the porch, when the front door opened.</p>
<p>Marcie had her handbag slung over her shoulder, keys in</p>
<p>hand, clearly on her way out. She froze in the doorway when she</p>
<p>saw me. “What are you doing here?” she asked.</p>
<p>I opened my mouth, three full seconds ticking by before</p>
<p>words came out. “I—I didn’t think you’d be home.”</p>
<p>She narrowed her eyes. “Well, I am.”</p>
<p>“I thought you … and Patch …” I was barely speaking</p>
<p>coherently. The diary was in my arms, in plain sight. Any minute</p>
<p>Marcie would see it.</p>
<p>“He canceled,” she snapped at me, like it was none of my</p>
<p>business.</p>
<p>I hardly heard her.Any moment now she was going to see the</p>
<p>I hardly heard her.Any moment now she was going to see the</p>
<p>diary. Like never before, I wanted to backpedal through time. I</p>
<p>should have thought this through before coming. I should have</p>
<p>counted on the chance that she’d be home. I glanced nervously</p>
<p>behind me, staring at the street as if it could somehow come to</p>
<p>my rescue.</p>
<p>Marcie gasped, a rush of air between her teeth. “What are</p>
<p>you doing with my diary?”</p>
<p>I spun around, cheeks flaming.</p>
<p>She marched down the porch. She snatched the diary away</p>
<p>and reflexively pinned it against her chest. “You—you took it?”</p>
<p>My hands fell uselessly to my sides. “I took it the night of your</p>
<p>party.” I shook my head. “It was a stupid thing to do. I’m so</p>
<p>sorry—”</p>
<p>“Did you read it?” she demanded.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“You liar,” she sneered. “You read it, didn’t you? Who</p>
<p>wouldn’t? I hate you! Is your life so boring that you have to go</p>
<p>snooping through mine? Did you read the whole thing, or just</p>
<p>the parts about you?”</p>
<p>I was on the verge of adamantly denying even opening it,</p>
<p>when Marcie’s words caused my thoughts to catch and rewind.</p>
<p>“Me? What did you write about me?”</p>
<p>She flung the diary onto the porch behind her, then</p>
<p>straightened up, squaring her shoulders. “What do I care?” she</p>
<p>said, crossing her arms and glaring at me. “Now you know the</p>
<p>truth. How does it feel knowing your mom is screwing other</p>
<p>people’s husbands?”</p>
<p>I gave a disbelieving laugh that held more than its share of</p>
<p>anger. “Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“You really think your mom is out of town all those nights? Ha!</p>
<p>”</p>
<p>I adopted Marcie’s posture. “Actually, I do.” What was she</p>
<p>insinuating?</p>
<p>“Then how do you explain why her car is parked down the</p>
<p>street one night a week?”</p>
<p>“You have the wrong person,” I said, feeling my rage boil up. I</p>
<p>was pretty sure I now knew exactly what Marcie was getting at.</p>
<p>How dare she accuse my mom of having an affair. And with her</p>
<p>dad, of all people. If he was the last man on the planet, my mom</p>
<p>wouldn’t be caught dead with him. I hated Marcie, and my mom</p>
<p>knew it. She wasn’t sleeping with Marcie’s father. She would</p>
<p>never do that to me. She would never do that to my dad. Never.</p>
<p>“Beige Taurus, license plate X4</p>
<p>I24?” Marcie’s voice was</p>
<p>arctic.</p>
<p>“So you know her license plate number,” I said after a</p>
<p>moment, trying to ignore the tightening sensation in my chest.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t prove anything.”</p>
<p>“Wake up, Nora. Our parents knew each other in high school.</p>
<p>Your mom and my dad. They were together.”</p>
<p>I shook my head. “That’s a lie. My mom has never said</p>
<p>anything about your dad.”</p>
<p>“Because she doesn’t want you to know.” Her eyes flashed.</p>
<p>“Because she’s still with him. He’s her dirty little secret.”</p>
<p>I shook my head harder, feeling like a broken doll. “Maybe</p>
<p>my mom knew your dad in high school, but that was a long time</p>
<p>ago, before she met my dad. You have the wrong person. You</p>
<p>saw someone else’s car parked down the street. When she’s</p>
<p>not home, she’s out of town, working.”</p>
<p>“I saw them together, Nora. It was your mom, so don’t even</p>
<p>try to make excuses for her. I went to school that day and spraypainted</p>
<p>your locker with a message to your mom. Don’t you get</p>
<p>it?” Her voice was a revolted hiss. “They were sleeping</p>
<p>together.All these years they’ve been doing it. Which means my</p>
<p>dad could be your dad.And you could be my—sister.”</p>
<p>Marcie’s words dropped like a blade between us.</p>
<p>I hugged my arms around my middle and turned away,</p>
<p>feeling like I might be sick. Tears choked up my throat, burning</p>
<p>the back of my nose. Without a word, I walked stiffly down</p>
<p>Marcie’s walk. I thought she might shout something worse at my</p>
<p>back, but there was nothing worse she could say.</p>
<p>I didn’t go to Patch’s.</p>
<p>I must have walked all the way back to Clementine, past the</p>
<p>bus stop, the park, and the city swimming pool, because the</p>
<p>next thing I remembered, I was sitting on a bench on the lawn in</p>
<p>front of the public library. A cone of streetlight fell over me. It was</p>
<p>a warm night, but I hugged my knees against my chest, my body</p>
<p>wracked with tremors. My thoughts were a jumble of haunting</p>
<p>theories.</p>
<p>I stared into the darkness settling around me. Headlights</p>
<p>swung down the street, grew closer, moved on. Sporadic</p>
<p>sitcom laughter carried out an open window across the street.</p>
<p>Pockets of cool air flushed goose bumps across my arms. The</p>
<p>heady smell of grass, musky and humid from the earlier sun,</p>
<p>suffocated me.</p>
<p>I lay back on the bench, shutting my eyes against the dusting</p>
<p>of stars. I laced my quivering hands on my stomach, my fingers</p>
<p>feeling like frozen twigs. Iwondered why life had to suck so hard</p>
<p>sometimes, wondered why it was the people I loved the most</p>
<p>who could disappoint me the hardest, wondered who I wanted</p>
<p>to direct my hate at more—Marcie, her dad, or my mom.</p>
<p>Deep inside, I clung to the hope that Marcie was wrong. I</p>
<p>hoped I’d get to fling this back in her face. But the sinking</p>
<p>sensation that seemed to tug me inside out told me I was only</p>
<p>setting myself up for disappointment.</p>
<p>I couldn’t pinpoint the memory, but it was within the last year</p>
<p>or so. Maybe shortly before my dad died … no. After. It had</p>
<p>been a warm day—spring. The funeral was over, my grace</p>
<p>period of grieving had ended, and I was back in school. Vee</p>
<p>had talked me into ditching class, and in those days, I didn’t</p>
<p>offer much resistance to anything. I floated along. I got by. On</p>
<p>the thought that my mom would be at work, we’d walked to my</p>
<p>house. It must have taken us all of seventh hour to get there.</p>
<p>As the farmhouse came into view, Vee yanked me off the</p>
<p>road.</p>
<p>“There’s a car in your driveway,” she said.</p>
<p>“Whose could it be? Looks like a Land Cruiser.”</p>
<p>“Your mom doesn’t drive one of those.”</p>
<p>“Do you think it’s a detective?” It wasn’t likely that a detective</p>
<p>“Do you think it’s a detective?” It wasn’t likely that a detective</p>
<p>would be driving a sixty- thousand-dollar SUV, but Iwas so used</p>
<p>to detectives stopping by, it was the first thought that came to</p>
<p>mind.</p>
<p>“Let’s get closer.” We were almost to the driveway when the front door opened</p>
<p>and voices carried out. My mom’s … and a deeper voice. A</p>
<p>man’s.</p>
<p>Vee lugged me to the side of the house, out of sight. We watched as Hank Millar climbed into the Land Cruiser</p>
<p>and drove away.</p>
<p>“Holy freakshow,” Vee said. “Normally I’d suspect foul play,</p>
<p>but your mom is as straightlaced as they come. I bet he was</p>
<p>trying to sell her a car.”</p>
<p>“He came all this way for that?”</p>
<p>“Heck yeah, babe. Car salesmen don’t know where to draw</p>
<p>the line.”</p>
<p>“She already has a car.”</p>
<p>“A Ford. That’s like Toyota’s worst enemy. Marcie’s dad</p>
<p>won’t be happy until the whole town is driving a Toyota….”</p>
<p>I strayed out of the memory. But what if he hadn’t been selling</p>
<p>her a car? What if they’d—I swallowed involuntarily—been</p>
<p>having an affair?</p>
<p>Where was I supposed to go now? Home? The farmhouse</p>
<p>no longer felt like home. It no longer felt safe and secure. It felt</p>
<p>like a box of lies. My parents had sold me a story about love,</p>
<p>togetherness, and family. But if Marcie was telling the truth —and my greatest fear was that she was—my family was a</p>
<p>joke. A big lie I’d never even seen coming. Shouldn’t there have</p>
<p>been warning signs? Shouldn’t I have been hit with the</p>
<p>realization that I’d secretly suspected this all along, but had</p>
<p>chosen denial over the painful truth? This was my punishment</p>
<p>for trusting others. This was my punishment for looking for the</p>
<p>good in people.As much as I hated Patch right now, I envied the</p>
<p>cold detachment that separated him from everyone else. He</p>
<p>suspected the worst in people; no matter how low they sank, he</p>
<p>always saw it coming. He was hardened and worldly, but people</p>
<p>respected him for it.</p>
<p>They respected him, and they lied to me.</p>
<p>I swung upright on the bench and punched my mom’s number</p>
<p>into my cell. I didn’t know what I’d say when she answered; I’d</p>
<p>let my anger and betrayal guide me. While her phone rang, hot</p>
<p>tears tumbled down my cheeks. I slapped them away. My chin</p>
<p>trembled, and every muscle in my body was drawn taut. Angry,</p>
<p>spiteful words sprang to mind. I envisioned shouting them at</p>
<p>her, cutting her off every time she tried to defend herself with</p>
<p>more lies.And if she cried … Iwouldn’t feel sorry. She deserved</p>
<p>to feel every last ounce of pain from the choices she’d made.</p>
<p>Her voice mail picked up, and it was all I could do to keep from</p>
<p>flinging the phone into the darkness.</p>
<p>I dialed Vee next.</p>
<p>“Yo, babe. Is this important? I’m with Rixon—”</p>
<p>“I’m leaving home,” I said, not caring that my voice sounded</p>
<p>thick from crying. “Can I stay at your house for a while? Until I</p>
<p>figure out where I’m going.”</p>
<p>Vee’s breathing filled my ear. “Say what?”</p>
<p>Vee’s breathing filled my ear. “Say what?”</p>
<p>“My mom gets home on Saturday. I want to be gone by then.</p>
<p>Can I stay with you the rest of the week?”</p>
<p>“Um, can I ask—”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Okay, sure,” Vee said, trying to hide her shock. “You can</p>
<p>stay, no problem. No problem at all. You’ll tell me what’s up</p>
<p>when you’re ready.”</p>
<p>I felt fresh tears well up inside me. Right now, Vee was the</p>
<p>only person I could count on. She could be obnoxious, annoying,</p>
<p>and lazy, but she never lied to me.</p>
<p>I got to the farmhouse around nine, and slipped into a pair of</p>
<p>cotton pj’s. It wasn’t a cold night, but the air was humid, and the</p>
<p>moisture seemed to slip beneath my skin, chilling me to the</p>
<p>bone. After making myself a cup of steamed milk, I sank into</p>
<p>bed. It was too early for sleep, but I couldn’t have slept if I’d</p>
<p>tried; my thoughts were still dashing themselves to pieces. I</p>
<p>stared at the ceiling, trying to erase the last sixteen years and</p>
<p>start fresh. Hard as I might, I couldn’t envision Hank Millar as my</p>
<p>father.</p>
<p>I swung out of bed and marched down the hall to my mom’s</p>
<p>bedroom. I flung open her hope chest, searching for her high</p>
<p>school yearbook. I didn’t even know if she owned one, but if she</p>
<p>did, the hope chest was the only place I could think to look. If</p>
<p>she and Hank Millar went to school together, there would be</p>
<p>pictures. If they’d been in love, he would have signed her</p>
<p>yearbook in some special way that would signify it. Five</p>
<p>minutes later, I’d thoroughly searched the chest and come up</p>
<p>empty-handed.</p>
<p>I padded to the kitchen, looked through the cupboards for</p>
<p>something to eat, but found my appetite gone. I couldn’t eat,</p>
<p>thinking about the big lie my family had turned out to be. I found</p>
<p>my eyes traveling to the front door, but where would I go? I felt</p>
<p>lost in the house, restless to leave, but with nowhere to run.After</p>
<p>standing in the hallway for several minutes, I climbed back to my</p>
<p>bedroom. Lying in bed with the covers pulled up to my chin, I</p>
<p>shut my eyes and watched a reel of pictures slide across my</p>
<p>mind. Pictures of Marcie; of Hank Millar, whom I barely knew,</p>
<p>and whose face I could conjure up only with difficulty; of my</p>
<p>parents. Faster and faster the images came, until they blended</p>
<p>together in a strange collage of madness.</p>
<p>The images seemed to lurch into reverse suddenly, traveling</p>
<p>backward through time. All color drained from the reel, until</p>
<p>there was nothing but fuzzy black and white. It was then that I</p>
<p>knew I’d slipped into the other realm.</p>
<p>Iwas dreaming.</p>
<p>I was standing in the front yard. A rowdy wind swept dead</p>
<p>leaves across the driveway, around my ankles. An odd funnel</p>
<p>cloud swirled in the sky overhead but made no move to touch</p>
<p>down, as if it was content to bide its time before striking. Patch</p>
<p>was sitting on the porch rail, head bowed, hands clasped</p>
<p>loosely between his knees.</p>
<p>“Get out of my dream,” I hollered at him over the wind.</p>
<p>He shook his head. “Not until I tell you what’s going on.”</p>
<p>I pulled my pajama top tighter. “I don’t want to hear what you</p>
<p>have to say.”</p>
<p>“The archangels can’t hear us here.”</p>
<p>I gave an accusatory laugh. “It wasn’t enough manipulating</p>
<p>me in real life—now you have to do it here, too?”</p>
<p>He lifted his head. “Manipulating? I’m trying to tell you what’s</p>
<p>going on.”</p>
<p>“You’re forcing your way inside my dreams,” I challenged.</p>
<p>“You did it after the Devil’s Handbag, and you’re doing it now.”</p>
<p>A sudden gust of wind blew between us, causing me to take</p>
<p>a step back. The tree branches creaked and moaned. I</p>
<p>untangled my hair from my face.</p>
<p>Patch said, “After the Z, in the Jeep, you told me you’d had a</p>
<p>dream about Marcie’s dad. The night you had the dream, I was</p>
<p>thinking about him. I was remembering the exact memory you</p>
<p>dreamed about, wishing there was some way I could tell you the</p>
<p>truth. I didn’t know Iwas communicating with you.”</p>
<p>“You made me have that dream?”</p>
<p>“Not a dream.A memory.”</p>
<p>I tried to digest this. If the dream was real, Hank Millar had</p>
<p>been living in England hundreds of years ago. My memory spun</p>
<p>back to the dream. Tell the barkeep to send help, Hank had</p>
<p>said. Tell him there is no man. Tell him it is one of the devil’s</p>
<p>angels, come to possess my body and cast away my soul.</p>
<p>Was Hank Millar—Nephilim?</p>
<p>“I don’t know how I overlapped your dreams,” Patch said, “but</p>
<p>I’ve been trying to communicate with you the same way ever</p>
<p>since. I got through the night I kissed you after the Devil’s</p>
<p>Handbag, but now I keep hitting walls. I’m lucky I’m here now. I</p>
<p>think it’s you. You’re not letting me in.”</p>
<p>“Because I don’t want you inside my head!”</p>
<p>He slid off the railing, coming down to meet me in the yard. “I</p>
<p>need you to let me in.”</p>
<p>I turned away.</p>
<p>“Iwas reassigned to Marcie,” he said.</p>
<p>Five seconds passed before everything fell into place. The</p>
<p>sick, hot feeling that had churned in my stomach since leaving</p>
<p>Marcie’s spread to my extremities. “You’re Marcie’s guardian</p>
<p>angel?”</p>
<p>“It hasn’t been a pleasure cruise.”</p>
<p>“Did the archangels do this?”</p>
<p>“When they assigned me as your guardian, they made it</p>
<p>clear I was supposed to have your best interests in mind.</p>
<p>Getting involved with you wasn’t in your best interest. I knew it,</p>
<p>but I didn’t like the idea of the archangels telling me what to do</p>
<p>with my personal life. They were watching us the night you gave</p>
<p>me your ring.”</p>
<p>In the Jeep. The night before we broke up. Iremembered.</p>
<p>“As soon as I realized they were watching us, I took off. But</p>
<p>the damage was done. They told me I’d be out as soon as they</p>
<p>found a replacement. Then they assigned me to Marcie. I went</p>
<p>to her house that night to force myself to face what I’d done.”</p>
<p>“Why Marcie?” I asked bitterly. “To punish me?”</p>
<p>He dragged a hand down over his mouth. “Marcie’s dad is a</p>
<p>He dragged a hand down over his mouth. “Marcie’s dad is a</p>
<p>first-generation Nephilim, a purebred. Now that Marcie is</p>
<p>sixteen, she’s in danger of being sacrificed. Two months ago,</p>
<p>when I tried to sacrifice you to get a human body, but ended up</p>
<p>saving your life, there weren’t many fallen angels who believed</p>
<p>they could change what they were. I’m a guardian now. They all</p>
<p>know it, and they all know it’s because I saved you from dying.</p>
<p>Suddenly a lot more of them believe they can cheat fate too.</p>
<p>Either by saving a human and getting their wings back”—he</p>
<p>exhaled—“or by killing their Nephil vassal and transforming their</p>
<p>body from fallen angel to human.”</p>
<p>I reviewed in my mind everything I knew about fallen angels</p>
<p>and Nephilim. The Book of Enoch told of a fallen angel who</p>
<p>became human after killing his Nephil vassal—by sacrificing</p>
<p>one of the vassal’s female descendants. Two months ago,</p>
<p>Patch had attempted this very thing by intending to use me to</p>
<p>kill Chauncey. Now, if the fallen angel who’d forced Hank Millar</p>
<p>to swear fealty wanted to become human, well, he’d have to …</p>
<p>Sacrifice Marcie.</p>
<p>I said, “You mean it’s your job to make sure the fallen angel</p>
<p>who forced Hank Millar to swear fealty doesn’t sacrifice Marcie</p>
<p>to get a human body.”</p>
<p>As if he thought he knew me well enough to guess my next</p>
<p>question, he said, “Marcie doesn’t know. She’s completely in</p>
<p>the dark.”</p>
<p>I didn’t want to talk about this. I didn’t want Patch here. He’d</p>
<p>killed my dad. He’d ripped away, forever, someone I loved.</p>
<p>Patch was a monster. Nothing he could say could make me feel</p>
<p>otherwise.</p>
<p>“Chauncey formed the Nephilim blood society,” Patch said.</p>
<p>My attention snapped back. “What? How do you know?”</p>
<p>He looked reluctant to answer. “I’ve accessed a few</p>
<p>memories. Other people’s memories.”</p>
<p>“Other people’s memories?” I was shocked when I shouldn’t</p>
<p>have been. How could he justify all the horrible things he’d</p>
<p>done? How could he come here and tell me he’d secretly</p>
<p>examined people’s most private and intimate thoughts, and</p>
<p>expect me to admire him for it? Or even expect me to listen to</p>
<p>him?</p>
<p>“A successor picked up where Chauncey left off. I haven’t</p>
<p>been able to get a name yet, but rumor has it he isn’t happy</p>
<p>about Chauncey’s death, which doesn’t make sense. He’s in</p>
<p>charge now—that alone should have wiped away any remorse</p>
<p>he felt over Chauncey’s death. Which makes me wonder if the</p>
<p>successor was a close friend of Chauncey’s, or a relative.”</p>
<p>I shook my head. “I don’t want to hear this.”</p>
<p>“The successor has a contract out on Chauncey’s killer.” Any</p>
<p>further protesting on my part died forming. Patch and I shared a</p>
<p>look. “He wants the killer to pay.”</p>
<p>“You mean he wants me to pay,” I said, my voice barely</p>
<p>pushing through.</p>
<p>“Nobody knows you killed Chauncey. He didn’t know you</p>
<p>were his female descendant until moments before he died, so</p>
<p>there’s little chance anyone else knew. Chauncey’s successor</p>
<p>might try to track down Chauncey’s descendants, but I wish him</p>
<p>luck. It took me a long time to find you.” He took a step toward</p>
<p>luck. It took me a long time to find you.” He took a step toward</p>
<p>me, but I backed up. “When you wake up, I need you to say you</p>
<p>want me as your guardian angel again. Say it like you mean it,</p>
<p>so the archangels hear it, and hopefully grant your request. I’m</p>
<p>doing everything I can to keep you safe, but I’m restricted. I</p>
<p>need heightened access to the people around you, your</p>
<p>emotions, everything in your world.” What was he saying? That the archangels had finally found</p>
<p>my replacement guardian angel? Was this why he’d forced his</p>
<p>way inside my dream tonight? Because he’d been cut off, and</p>
<p>no longer had the access to me that he wanted?</p>
<p>I felt his hands slide to my hips, holding me protectively</p>
<p>against him. “I’m not going to let anything happen to you.”</p>
<p>I stiffened and shrugged free. My mind was in a tempest. He</p>
<p>wants the killer to pay. I couldn’t shake off the thought. The idea</p>
<p>that someone out there wanted to kill me was numbing. I didn’t</p>
<p>want to be here. I didn’t want to know these things. I wanted to</p>
<p>feel safe again.</p>
<p>Realizing that Patch had no intention of leaving my dream, I</p>
<p>made my own move. I fought against the invisible barriers of the</p>
<p>dream by forcing myself awake. Open your eyes, I told myself.</p>
<p>Open them!</p>
<p>Patch gripped my elbow. “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>I could feel myself becoming more lucid. I could feel the</p>
<p>warmth of my sheets, my pillowcase soft against my cheek. All</p>
<p>the familiar smells associated with my room comforted me.</p>
<p>“Don’t wake up, Angel.” He smoothed his hands against my</p>
<p>hair, trapping my face, forcing me to look him in the eye.</p>
<p>“There’s more you need to know. There’s a very important</p>
<p>reason why you need to see these memories. I’m trying to tell</p>
<p>you something that I can’t tell you any other way. I need you to</p>
<p>figure out what I’m trying to tell you. I need you to stop blocking</p>
<p>me.”</p>
<p>I jerked my face away. My feet seemed to rise up from the</p>
<p>grass, drifting toward the stirring funnel cloud. Patch grabbed</p>
<p>for me, swearing under his breath, but his hold on me was</p>
<p>featherlight, imaginary. Wake up, I ordered myself. Wake up.</p>
<p>I let the cloud consume me.</p><p>

<p></p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>I WOKE UP WITH A SHARP INTAKE OF AIR. MY ROOM was settled in</p>
<p>shadow, the moon glowing like a crystal ball on the far side of</p>
<p>the window. My sheets were hot and damp, tangled around my</p>
<p>legs. The clock read nine thirty.</p>
<p>I flung myself out of bed and went to the bathroom, filling a</p>
<p>cold glass of water. I gulped it down, then leaned against the</p>
<p>wall. I couldn’t fall back asleep. Whatever I did, I couldn’t let</p>
<p>Patch back in my dreams. I paced the upstairs hall, frantically</p>
<p>trying to keep myself wide awake, but I was so worked up, I</p>
<p>doubted I could have slept if I’d wanted to.</p>
<p>Several minutes later the throb of my pulse had died down,</p>
<p>but my mind wasn’t as easy to settle. The Black Hand. Those</p>
<p>three words haunted me. They were elusive, menacing,</p>
<p>taunting. I couldn’t bring myself to look them straight on. Not</p>
<p>without feeling my already flimsy world start to shatter. I knew I</p>
<p>was avoiding finding a way to let the archangels know Patch</p>
<p>was the Black Hand, and my father’s killer, to protect myself</p>
<p>from the shameful truth: I’d fallen in love with a killer. I’d let him</p>
<p>kiss me, lie to me, betray me. When he touched me in my</p>
<p>dreams, all my strength crumbled, and I felt myself being</p>
<p>tangled up in his net all over again. He still held my heart in his</p>
<p>hand, and that was the biggest betrayal of all. What kind of</p>
<p>person was I, when I couldn’t bring my own father’s killer to</p>
<p>justice?</p>
<p>Patch had said I could tell the archangels Iwanted him as my</p>
<p>guardian angel again through the simple act of saying it out</p>
<p>loud. It seemed logical, then, that I could shout out, “Patch killed</p>
<p>my dad!” and be done with it. Justice would be served. Patch</p>
<p>would be sent to hell, and I could slowly start to rebuild my life.</p>
<p>But I couldn’t pull the words up, as if they were chained down</p>
<p>someplace deep inside me.</p>
<p>Too many things weren’t adding up. Why was Patch, an</p>
<p>angel, mixed up with a Nephilim blood society? If he was the</p>
<p>Black Hand, why was he branding Nephilim recruits? Why was</p>
<p>he recruiting them in the first place? It wasn’t just odd—it was</p>
<p>illogical. The Nephilim race hated angels, and vice versa. And if</p>
<p>the Black Hand was Chauncey’s successor and the new leader</p>
<p>of the society … how could that person possibly be Patch?</p>
<p>I squeezed the bridge of my nose, feeling like my head might</p>
<p>crack from chasing the same questions over and over. Why was</p>
<p>it that everything surrounding the Black Hand seemed to be an</p>
<p>endless maze of trapdoor, after trapdoor, after trapdoor?</p>
<p>Right now Scott was my only reliable link left to the Black</p>
<p>Hand. He knew more than he was letting on, I was sure of it, but</p>
<p>he was too scared to talk. The tone of his voice when he’d</p>
<p>spoken of the Black Hand carried sheer panic. I needed him to</p>
<p>tell me what he knew, but he was running from his past, and</p>
<p>nothing I said was going to make him turn back and face it. I</p>
<p>pressed my forehead into the palms of my hands, trying to think</p>
<p>pressed my forehead into the palms of my hands, trying to think</p>
<p>clearly.</p>
<p>I called Vee.</p>
<p>“Good news,” she said before I could get a word in</p>
<p>edgewise. “I talked my dad into driving back to the beach with</p>
<p>me and paying the fine to get the boot off my car. I’m back in</p>
<p>business.”</p>
<p>“Good, because I need your help.”</p>
<p>“Help is my middle name.”</p>
<p>I was pretty sure she’d already told me bad was her middle</p>
<p>name, but I kept my opinion to myself. “I need someone to help</p>
<p>me look through Scott’s bedroom.” Chances were, Scott wasn’t</p>
<p>going to keep any evidence detailing his involvement with the</p>
<p>Nephilim blood society out in the open, but what alternative did I</p>
<p>have? He had done a terrific job of not giving me direct</p>
<p>answers in the past, and after our last encounter, I knew he was</p>
<p>wary of me. If I wanted to find out what he knew, I was going to</p>
<p>have to do a little legwork.</p>
<p>“Apparently Patch canceled our double date, so my schedule</p>
<p>is wide open,” Vee said, a little too eagerly. I’d expected her to</p>
<p>ask what we were snooping for in Scott’s bedroom.</p>
<p>“Going through Scott’s bedroom isn’t going to be dangerous</p>
<p>or exciting,” I told her, just to make sure we were both on the</p>
<p>same page. “All you’re going to do is sit in the Neon outside his</p>
<p>apartment and call me if you see him coming home. I’m the one</p>
<p>who’s going inside.”</p>
<p>“Just because I’m not doing the spying doesn’t mean it’s not</p>
<p>exciting. It’ll be like watching a movie. Only, in the movies the</p>
<p>good guy almost never gets caught. But this is real life, and</p>
<p>there’s a strong chance you’ll get caught. See what Imean? The</p>
<p>excitement factor is through the roof.”</p>
<p>Personally, I thought Vee was a little overanxious to see me</p>
<p>caught.</p>
<p>“You are going to warn me if Scott comes home, right?” I</p>
<p>asked.</p>
<p>“Heck yeah, babe. I’ve got you covered.”</p>
<p>My next call was to Scott’s home line. Mrs. Parnell picked up.</p>
<p>“Nora, so good to hear your voice! Scott tells me things have</p>
<p>been heating up between the two of you,” she added in a</p>
<p>conspirator’s voice.</p>
<p>“Well, uh—”</p>
<p>“I always thought it would be real nice if Scott married a local</p>
<p>girl. I don’t much like the idea of him marrying into a family of</p>
<p>strangers. What if his in-laws are nutcases? Your mom and I are</p>
<p>such close friends, can you imagine the fun we’d have planning</p>
<p>a wedding together? But I’m getting ahead of myself! All in</p>
<p>good time, as they say.”</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>“Is Scott there, Mrs. Parnell? I have some news I think he’ll be</p>
<p>interested in.”</p>
<p>I heard her cup a hand over the mouthpiece and shout,</p>
<p>“Scott! Pick up the phone! It’s Nora!”</p>
<p>A moment later Scott came on. “You can hang up now, Mom.”</p>
<p>His voice held a drop of wariness.</p>
<p>“Just making sure you got it, hon.”</p>
<p>“I’ve got it.”</p>
<p>“Nora has some interesting news,” she said.</p>
<p>“Then hang up so she can tell me.”</p>
<p>There was a sigh of disappointment, and a click.</p>
<p>“I thought I told you to stay away from me,” Scott said.</p>
<p>“Have you found a band yet?” I asked, pushing forward,</p>
<p>hoping to take control of the conversation and pique his interest</p>
<p>before he hung up on me.</p>
<p>“No,” he said with that same guarded skepticism.</p>
<p>“Imentioned to a friend that you play the guitar—”</p>
<p>“I play bass.”</p>
<p>“—and he spread the word and found a band that wants to</p>
<p>audition you. Tonight.”</p>
<p>“What’s the name of the band?”</p>
<p>I hadn’t anticipated that question. “Uh—the Pigmen.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like something out of 1960.”</p>
<p>“Do you want the audition or not?”</p>
<p>“What time?”</p>
<p>“Ten. At the Devil’s Handbag.” If I’d known of a warehouse</p>
<p>farther away, I would have mentioned it. As it was, I would have</p>
<p>to make do with the twenty minutes it would take him to drive</p>
<p>round trip.</p>
<p>“I’ll need a contact name and number.”</p>
<p>He definitely was not supposed to ask that.</p>
<p>I said, “I told my friend I’d pass the information along to you,</p>
<p>but I didn’t think to ask for names and numbers of the band</p>
<p>members.”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to blow my night on an audition without first</p>
<p>getting an idea of who these guys are, what style they play, and</p>
<p>where they’ve gigged.Are they punk, indie-pop, metal?”</p>
<p>“What are you?”</p>
<p>“Punk.”</p>
<p>“I’ll get their numbers and call you right back.”</p>
<p>I disconnected from Scott and immediately dialed Vee. “I told</p>
<p>Scott I got him an audition with a band tonight, but he wants to</p>
<p>know what kind of music the band plays and where they’ve</p>
<p>played. If I give him your number, would you pretend to be the</p>
<p>girlfriend of someone from the band? Just say you always</p>
<p>answer your boyfriend’s phone when he’s practicing. Don’t</p>
<p>elaborate further. Stick to the facts: They’re a punk band, they’re</p>
<p>the next big thing, and he’d be stupid not to audition.”</p>
<p>“I’m really starting to like all this spy work,” Vee said. “When</p>
<p>my normal life gets boring, all I have to do is sidle up next to</p>
<p>you.”</p>
<p>Iwas sitting on the front porch with my knees tucked against my</p>
<p>chest when Vee cruised up.</p>
<p>“I think we should stop at Skippy’s for hot dogs before we do</p>
<p>this,” she said when I swung in. “I don’t know what it is about hot</p>
<p>dogs, but they’re like an instant shot of courage. I feel like I can</p>
<p>do anything after I’ve had a hot dog.”</p>
<p>“That’s because you’re high on all the toxins they pump</p>
<p>inside those things.”</p>
<p>“Like I said, I think we should stop by Skippy’s.”</p>
<p>“I already had pasta for dinner.”</p>
<p>“Pasta isn’t very filling.”</p>
<p>“Pasta is very filling.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but not in the way mustard and relish are,” Vee</p>
<p>argued.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, we were leaving the drive-through at</p>
<p>Skippy’s with two grilled hot dogs, one large carton of fries, and</p>
<p>two strawberry milk shakes.</p>
<p>“I hate this kind of food,” I said, feeling grease seep through</p>
<p>the wax-paper-wrapped hot dog onto my hand. “It’s unhealthy.”</p>
<p>“So’s a relationship with Patch, but that didn’t stop you.”</p>
<p>I didn’t respond.</p>
<p>A quarter mile from Scott’s complex, Vee steered to the side</p>
<p>of the road. The biggest problem I foresaw was our location.</p>
<p>Deacon Road dead-ended just past the complex. Vee and I</p>
<p>were out in the open, and as soon as Scott drove past and saw</p>
<p>Vee sitting in the Neon, he’d know something was up. I hadn’t</p>
<p>been worried that he’d recognize her voice on the phone, but I</p>
<p>was worried he’d remember her face. He’d seen us together on</p>
<p>more than one occasion, and had even seen us tailing him in</p>
<p>the Neon once. She was guilty by association.</p>
<p>“You’re going to have to drive off the road and park behind</p>
<p>those bushes,” I instructed Vee.</p>
<p>Vee leaned forward, peering into the darkness. “Is that a</p>
<p>ditch between me and the bushes?”</p>
<p>“It’s not very deep. Trust me, we’ll clear it.”</p>
<p>“Looks deep to me. This is a Neon we’re talking about, not a</p>
<p>Hummer.”</p>
<p>“The Neon doesn’t weigh very much. If we get stuck, I’ll get</p>
<p>out and push.”</p>
<p>Vee put the car in drive and hopped the shoulder of the road,</p>
<p>the sound of overgrown weeds dragging along the</p>
<p>undercarriage.</p>
<p>“More g-gas!” I said, my teeth knocking together as we</p>
<p>bounced over the rocky embankment. The car tipped forward</p>
<p>and raced into the ditch, and the front tires slammed to a stop,</p>
<p>hitting bottom.</p>
<p>“I don’t think we’re going to make it up,” Vee said, feeding</p>
<p>the Neon more gas. The tires spun but didn’t find traction. “I</p>
<p>need to approach this sucker from an angle.” She cranked the</p>
<p>wheel a hard left and punched the gas again. “That’s more like</p>
<p>it,” she said as the Neon dug in and lurched forward.</p>
<p>“Watch out for the rock—,” I began, but it was too late.</p>
<p>Vee drove the Neon straight over a large jutting rock half</p>
<p>buried in the earth. She stomped on the brake and killed the</p>
<p>engine. We got out and stared at the front left tire.</p>
<p>“Something doesn’t look right,” Vee said. “Is the tire</p>
<p>supposed to look like that?”</p>
<p>I banged my head against the nearest tree trunk.</p>
<p>“So we’ve got a flat,” Vee said. “What now?”</p>
<p>“We stick to the plan. I’ll search Scott’s room, and you’ll keep</p>
<p>a lookout. When I get back, you’ll call Rixon.”</p>
<p>“And tell him what?”</p>
<p>“That we saw a deer and you swerved to miss it. That’s when</p>
<p>you ran the Neon into the ditch and over a rock.”</p>
<p>you ran the Neon into the ditch and over a rock.”</p>
<p>“I like that story,” said Vee. “It makes me sound like an animal</p>
<p>lover. Rixon will like that.”</p>
<p>“Any questions?” I asked her.</p>
<p>“Nope, I’ve got it. Call you as soon as Scott leaves the</p>
<p>premises. Call you again if he comes back and warn you to get</p>
<p>the heck out of there.” Vee dropped her eyes to my footwear.</p>
<p>“Are you going to scale the building and climb in through a</p>
<p>window? Because you might have wanted to wear tennis shoes</p>
<p>for that. Your ballet flats are cute, but not practical.”</p>
<p>“I’m going in through the front door.”</p>
<p>“What are you going to say to Scott’s mom?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter. She likes me. She’ll let me walk right</p>
<p>inside.” I held out my hot dog, which had grown cold. “Do you</p>
<p>want this?”</p>
<p>“No way. You’re going to need it. If anything bad happens, just</p>
<p>take a bite. Ten seconds later, you’ll feel all warm and happy</p>
<p>inside.”</p>
<p>I jogged the rest of the way down Deacon, veering off into the</p>
<p>shadows of the trees as soon as I could make out a human form</p>
<p>moving back and forth across the lighted windows of Scott’s</p>
<p>third-story apartment. From what I could tell, Mrs. Parnell was in</p>
<p>the kitchen, moving between the fridge and the sink, most likely</p>
<p>baking dessert or throwing together a snack. The light in Scott’s</p>
<p>bedroom was on, but the shades were drawn. The light blinked</p>
<p>out, and a moment later Scott entered the kitchen and brushed</p>
<p>a kiss on his mom’s cheek.</p>
<p>I stayed put, swatting mosquitoes for five minutes, before</p>
<p>Scott walked out the front door carrying what looked like a</p>
<p>guitar case. He stowed the case in the trunk of the Mustang and</p>
<p>backed out of the parking space.</p>
<p>A minute later, Vee’s ringtone sounded in my pocket.</p>
<p>“The eagle has flown the nest,” she said.</p>
<p>“I know,” I said. “Stay where you are. I’m going in.”</p>
<p>I hiked up to the front door and rang the bell. The door</p>
<p>opened, and as soon as Mrs. Parnell saw me, she broke into a</p>
<p>wide smile.</p>
<p>“Nora!” she said, grasping me good-naturedly by the</p>
<p>shoulders. “You just missed Scott. He left to audition with the</p>
<p>band. I can’t tell you how much it means to him that you went to</p>
<p>the trouble to set this up. He’s going to knock the socks off the</p>
<p>other band members. Just you wait and see.” She pinched my</p>
<p>cheek affectionately.</p>
<p>“Actually, Scott just called me. He left some of his sheet</p>
<p>music here and asked if I could pick it up. He would have come</p>
<p>back for it himself, but he didn’t want to show up late to the</p>
<p>audition and make a bad impression.”</p>
<p>“Oh! Yes, of course! Come right in. Did he say which music</p>
<p>he wanted?”</p>
<p>“He texted me a couple of titles.”</p>
<p>She drew the door all the way open. “I’ll walk you back to his</p>
<p>room. Scott will be so upset if the audition doesn’t go just the</p>
<p>way he wants. He’s usually so particular about taking the right</p>
<p>music, but it all happened on such short notice. I’m sure he’s</p>
<p>going out of his mind, poor thing.”</p>
<p>“He sounded really upset,” I agreed. “I’ll hurry as fast as I can.</p>
<p>”</p>
<p>Mrs. Parnell led the way down the hall. As I stepped across</p>
<p>the threshold into Scott’s bedroom, I took in the complete</p>
<p>change of scenery. The first thing I noticed was the black paint</p>
<p>on the walls. They’d been white the last time I came over. The</p>
<p>Godfather poster and the New England Patriots pennant had</p>
<p>been ripped down. The air smelled heavily of paint and</p>
<p>Febreze.</p>
<p>“You’ll have to excuse the walls,” Mrs. Parnell said. “Scott’s</p>
<p>been going through a bit of an emotional downturn. Moving can</p>
<p>be hard. He needs to get out more.” She looked meaningfully at</p>
<p>me. I pretended to miss the hint.</p>
<p>“So that’s the sheet music?” I asked, gesturing at a heap of</p>
<p>paper on the floor.</p>
<p>Mrs. Parnell wiped her hands on her apron. “Do you want me</p>
<p>to help you hunt down the titles?”</p>
<p>“It’s no problem, really. I don’t want to keep you. It’ll just take</p>
<p>me a second.”</p>
<p>As soon as she left, I closed the door. I set my cell and the</p>
<p>Skippy’s hot dog on the desk opposite the bed, then moved to</p>
<p>the closet.</p>
<p>A pair of white high-tops stuck out from a mound of jeans</p>
<p>and T-shirts on the floor. Only three lumberjack shirts were left</p>
<p>on hangers. I wondered if Mrs. Parnell had bought them,</p>
<p>because I couldn’t picture Scott in flannel.</p>
<p>Under the bed I found one aluminum bat, one baseball mitt,</p>
<p>and one potted plant. I called Vee.</p>
<p>“What does marijuana look like?”</p>
<p>“Five leaves,” Vee said.</p>
<p>“Scott is growing marijuana in here. Under his bed.”</p>
<p>“Are you surprised?”</p>
<p>I wasn’t, but it did explain the Febreze. I wasn’t sure I could</p>
<p>picture Scott smoking pot, but I wouldn’t put him past selling it.</p>
<p>He was desperate for cash.</p>
<p>“I’ll call back if I find anything else,” I said. I dropped my cell</p>
<p>on Scott’s bed and turned a slow circle around the room. There</p>
<p>weren’t many hiding places. The underside of the desk was</p>
<p>clean. The heating vents were empty. Nothing was sewn into his</p>
<p>blanket. I was about to give up when something high in the</p>
<p>closet caught my eye. There was damage to the wall.</p>
<p>I dragged the desk chair over and stepped up. A mediumsize</p>
<p>square hole had been cut out of the wall, but the plaster</p>
<p>had been replaced to make it appear as if the hole wasn’t</p>
<p>there. Using a wire hanger, I reached up as high as I could and</p>
<p>knocked the square of plaster out. From what I could tell, an</p>
<p>orange Nike shoe box was crammed into the space. I jabbed at</p>
<p>it with the hanger, but ended up pushing it farther back.</p>
<p>A soft buzzing sound broke my concentration, and I realized</p>
<p>my cell was ringing on vibrate, the blankets on Scott’s bed</p>
<p>muffling the sound.</p>
<p>I jumped down. “Vee?” I answered.</p>
<p>“Get out of there!” she hissed in a panicked undertone.</p>
<p>“Scott called again and asked for directions to the warehouse,</p>
<p>but I didn’t know which warehouse you told him. I sort of stalled</p>
<p>but I didn’t know which warehouse you told him. I sort of stalled</p>
<p>and said I was only the girlfriend, and I didn’t know where the</p>
<p>band held its auditions. He asked which warehouse they</p>
<p>practiced at, and I said I didn’t know that, either. The good news</p>
<p>is, he hung up, so I didn’t have to lie my way into a bigger hole.</p>
<p>The bad news is, he’s on his way home. Right now.”</p>
<p>“How much time do I have?”</p>
<p>“Since he already flew past here at about a hundred miles</p>
<p>per hour, I’d guess a minute. Or less.”</p>
<p>“Vee!”</p>
<p>“Don’t blame me—you’re the one who wasn’t answering your</p>
<p>phone!”</p>
<p>“Chase him down and stall for time. I need two more minutes.</p>
<p>”</p>
<p>“Chase him down? How? The Neon has a flat.”</p>
<p>“With your own two feet!”</p>
<p>“You mean exercise?”</p>
<p>Cradling the phone under my chin, I found a scrap of paper in</p>
<p>my handbag and hunted through Scott’s desk for a pen. “It’s</p>
<p>less than a fourth of a mile. That’s one lap around the track.</p>
<p>Go!”</p>
<p>“What do I say when I catch him?”</p>
<p>“This is what spies do—they improvise. You’ll think of</p>
<p>something. I have to go.” I broke the connection. Where were all the pens? How could Scott have a desk with</p>
<p>no pens, no pencils? Finally I found one in my bag and</p>
<p>scribbled a quick note on the scrap of paper. I slid the paper</p>
<p>under the hot dog.</p>
<p>Outside, I heard the Mustang roar into the complex’s parking</p>
<p>lot.</p>
<p>I crossed to the closet and climbed up a second time. I was</p>
<p>stretched on my tiptoes, stabbing at the box with the hanger.</p>
<p>The front door slammed.</p>
<p>“Scott?” I heard Mrs. Parnell say from the kitchen. “What are</p>
<p>you doing back so soon?”</p>
<p>I got the hook part of the hanger under the lip of the lid and</p>
<p>coaxed it out of the compartment. Once I had it halfway out,</p>
<p>gravity did the rest. The box dropped into my hands. I’d just</p>
<p>shoved it inside my bag and one-armed the chair back to its</p>
<p>place at the desk, when the bedroom door smacked open.</p>
<p>Scott’s eyes found me in an instant. “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>he demanded.</p>
<p>“Iwasn’t expecting you to come back so fast,” I stammered.</p>
<p>“The audition was fake, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>“I—”</p>
<p>“You wanted me out of the apartment.” He crossed to me in</p>
<p>two steps and took my arm, giving me a rough shake. “You</p>
<p>made a big mistake coming here.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Parnell moved into the doorway. “What’s the matter,</p>
<p>Scott? For heaven’s sake, let her go! She came by to pick up</p>
<p>the sheet music you forgot.”</p>
<p>“She’s lying. I didn’t forget any sheet music.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Parnell looked at me. “Is that true?”</p>
<p>“I lied,” I confessed shakily. I swallowed, trying to inject a</p>
<p>measure of calm into my voice. “The thing is, I really wanted to</p>
<p>ask Scott to the Summer Solstice party at Delphic, but I couldn’t</p>
<p>ask Scott to the Summer Solstice party at Delphic, but I couldn’t</p>
<p>bring myself to do it in person. This is really awkward.” I walked</p>
<p>to the desk and offered him the hot dog along with the scrap of</p>
<p>paper I’d scribbled the note on.</p>
<p>“‘Don’t be a wiener,’” Scott read. “‘Go to Summer Solstice</p>
<p>with me.’”</p>
<p>“Well? What do you think?” I tried to hold a smile. “Do you</p>
<p>want to be a wiener or not?”</p>
<p>Scott looked from the note to the hot dog to me. “What?”</p>
<p>“Well, isn’t that the cutest thing ever,” Mrs. Parnell chimed in.</p>
<p>“You don’t want to be a wiener, do you, Scott?”</p>
<p>“Give us a minute, Mom?”</p>
<p>“Is Summer Solstice a dress-up party?” Mrs. Parnell asked.</p>
<p>“Like a dance? I could make a reservation at Todd’s Tuxes—”</p>
<p>“Mom.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Right. I’ll just be in the kitchen. Nora, I’ve got to hand it to</p>
<p>you. I had no idea you were up here planting an invite to the</p>
<p>party. I really thought you were picking up sheet music. Very</p>
<p>clever.” She winked, then backed out, pulling the door shut</p>
<p>behind her.</p>
<p>Iwas left alone with Scott, and all my relief scattered.</p>
<p>“What are you really doing here?” Scott repeated, his voice</p>
<p>significantly darker.</p>
<p>“I told you—”</p>
<p>“Not buying it.” His eyes flicked beyond me, surveying the</p>
<p>room. “What did you touch?”</p>
<p>“I came by to give you the hot dog, I swear. I looked in the</p>
<p>desk for a pen to write the wiener note, but that’s it.”</p>
<p>Scott strode to the desk, pulled out each drawer, and sifted</p>
<p>through the contents. “I know you’re lying.”</p>
<p>I backed toward the door. “You know what? Keep the hot</p>
<p>dog, but forget about Summer Solstice. I was just trying to be</p>
<p>nice. I was trying to make up for the other night, because I felt</p>
<p>responsible for your face getting smashed. Forget I said</p>
<p>anything.”</p>
<p>He assessed me in silence. I had no idea if he’d bought my</p>
<p>act, but I didn’t care. The only thought running through my mind</p>
<p>was of getting out.</p>
<p>“I’ve got my eye on you,” he said at last, in a tone I found to</p>
<p>be startlingly threatening. I’d never seen Scott so icily hostile.</p>
<p>“Think about that. Every time you think you’re alone, think again.</p>
<p>I’m watching you. If I ever catch you in my room again, you’re</p>
<p>dead. We all clear?”</p>
<p>I swallowed. “Crystal.”</p>
<p>On my way out, I passed Mrs. Parnell standing near the</p>
<p>fireplace, drinking a glass of iced tea. She took a swig, set the</p>
<p>glass on the mantel, and flagged me down.</p>
<p>“Scott is quite the boy, isn’t he?” she said.</p>
<p>“That’s one way of putting it.”</p>
<p>“I bet you asked him to the party early because you knew all</p>
<p>the other girls would race to get in line if you didn’t act fast.”</p>
<p>Summer Solstice was tomorrow night, and everyone going</p>
<p>already had dates. Unable to tell this to Mrs. Parnell, I opted for</p>
<p>a smile. She could interpret it however she wanted.</p>
<p>“Do I need to get him fitted for a tux?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Actually, the party is really casual. Jeans and a shirt are</p>
<p>“Actually, the party is really casual. Jeans and a shirt are</p>
<p>fine.” I’d let Scott break the news to her that we were no longer</p>
<p>going together.</p>
<p>Her face fell slightly. “Well, there’s always homecoming. I</p>
<p>don’t suppose you’re planning to ask him to homecoming?”</p>
<p>“I really haven’t thought about it yet. And anyway, Scott might</p>
<p>not want to go with me.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be silly! You and Scott go way back. He’s crazy about</p>
<p>you.”</p>
<p>Or crazy, period.</p>
<p>“I have to go, Mrs. Parnell. It was great seeing you again.”</p>
<p>“Drive safely!” she called, giving me a finger wave.</p>
<p>I met Vee outside in the parking lot. She was hunched over,</p>
<p>fists pressed into her knees, sucking air. A splotch of sweat</p>
<p>stained the back of her shirt.</p>
<p>“Nice decoy work,” I said.</p>
<p>She looked up, her face pink as a Christmas ham. “You ever</p>
<p>try chasing down a car?” she gasped.</p>
<p>“I’ll one-up you. I gave Scott my hot dog and asked if he’d go</p>
<p>to Summer Solstice with me.”</p>
<p>“What does the hot dog have to do with anything?”</p>
<p>“I said he’d be a wiener if he didn’t go with me.”</p>
<p>Vee wheezed laughter. “I’d have run harder had I known I’d</p>
<p>get to see you call him a wiener.”</p>
<p>Forty-five minutes later, Vee’s dad had called AAA and had the</p>
<p>Neon towed back onto the road and dropped me off in front of</p>
<p>the farmhouse. I didn’t waste any time clearing off the kitchen</p>
<p>table and shaking Scott’s shoe box out of my handbag. Multiple</p>
<p>layers of duct tape were wrapped around the box, nearly a</p>
<p>quarter of an inch thick. Whatever Scott was hiding, he didn’t</p>
<p>want the rest of the world finding it.</p>
<p>I sawed through the tape with a steak knife. I freed the lid, set</p>
<p>it aside, and peered into the box. A plain white tube sock lay</p>
<p>innocently at the bottom.</p>
<p>I stared at the sock, feeling my heart drop with</p>
<p>disappointment. Then I frowned. I stretched the sock open just</p>
<p>wide enough to look inside. My knees went soft.</p>
<p>Inside was a ring. One of the Black Hand’s rings.</p><p>

<p></p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>I STAREDAT THE RINGBLANKLY. I COULD HARDLYCONTAIN my thoughts.</p>
<p>Two rings? I didn’t know what it meant. Clearly the Black Hand</p>
<p>had more than one ring, but why did Scott have one? And why</p>
<p>had he gone to the trouble of hiding it in a secret compartment</p>
<p>in his wall?</p>
<p>And why, if he was so ashamed of the branding on his chest,</p>
<p>was he holding on to the ring that presumably had given it to</p>
<p>him?</p>
<p>In my bedroom, I dug my cello out of the closet and stowed</p>
<p>Scott’s ring in the zippered music pouch, right next to its twin,</p>
<p>the ring I’d received by envelope last week. I didn’t know how to</p>
<p>make sense of it. I’d gone to Scott’s looking for answers, and</p>
<p>was left feeling more confused than ever. I would have dwelt on</p>
<p>the rings longer, maybe pieced together a few theories, but I</p>
<p>was at a complete and utter loss. When the grandfather clock chimed midnight, I doublechecked</p>
<p>the door locks one last time and crawled into bed. I</p>
<p>propped my pillows up, sat upright, and painted my fingernails</p>
<p>midnight blue. After my fingernails, I moved on to my toenails. I</p>
<p>turned on my iPod. I read several chapters in my chemistry text.</p>
<p>I knew I couldn’t go forever without sleep, but I was determined</p>
<p>to put it off as long as possible. I was terrified Patch would be</p>
<p>waiting for me on the other side if I did.</p>
<p>I hadn’t realized I’d fallen asleep until I woke to a strange</p>
<p>scraping sound. I lay in bed, frozen, straining to hear the sound</p>
<p>again and place it. The drapes were drawn, the room shadowy.</p>
<p>I slipped out of bed and dared a look through the drapes. The</p>
<p>backyard was still. Undisturbed. Deceptively peaceful.</p>
<p>A low creak sounded downstairs. I grabbed my cell phone off</p>
<p>the nightstand and opened my bedroom door just wide enough</p>
<p>to peer out. The hall outside was clear, and I turned into it, my</p>
<p>heart beating so hard against my ribs, I thought my chest might</p>
<p>crack. I’d made it to the top of the stairs when the softest click</p>
<p>alerted me that the knob on the front door was turning.</p>
<p>The door opened, and a figure stepped cautiously into the</p>
<p>dark foyer. Scott was in my house, standing fifteen feet away, at</p>
<p>the base of the stairs. I steadied my grip on the cell phone,</p>
<p>which was slick with sweat.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?” I called down to Scott.</p>
<p>He jerked his head up, startled. He raised his hands level</p>
<p>with his shoulders, showing he was harmless. “We need to talk.”</p>
<p>“The door was locked. How did you get in?” My voice was</p>
<p>high, shaky.</p>
<p>He didn’t answer, but he didn’t need to. Scott was</p>
<p>Nephilim— freakishly strong. I was almost positive that if I’d</p>
<p>walked down to check the deadbolt, I would have found it</p>
<p>damaged by the sheer strength of his hands.</p>
<p>“Breaking and entering is illegal,” I said.</p>
<p>“So’s theft. You stole something that belongs to me.”</p>
<p>“So’s theft. You stole something that belongs to me.”</p>
<p>I moistened my lips. “You have one of the Black Hand’s rings.</p>
<p>”</p>
<p>“It’s not mine. I—I stole it.” His slight hesitation told me he</p>
<p>was lying. “Give me the ring back, Nora.”</p>
<p>“Not until you tell me everything.”</p>
<p>“We can do this the hard way, if you want.” He climbed the</p>
<p>first step.</p>
<p>“Don’t move!” I ordered, scrambling to dial 911 on my cell. “If</p>
<p>you come another step, I’ll call the police.”</p>
<p>“It will take the police twenty minutes to get out here.”</p>
<p>“That’s not true.” But we both knew it was.</p>
<p>He advanced to the second step.</p>
<p>“Stop”, I ordered. “I’ll place the call, I swear Iwill.”</p>
<p>“And tell them what? That you broke into my room? That you</p>
<p>stole valuable jewelry?”</p>
<p>“Your mom let me inside,” I said nervously.</p>
<p>“She wouldn’t have, if she’d known you were going to steal</p>
<p>from me.” He took another step, the stairs creaking under his</p>
<p>weight.</p>
<p>I racked my brain for a way to divert him from climbing</p>
<p>higher. At the same time, I wanted to goad him into telling me</p>
<p>the truth, once and for all. “You lied to me about the Black Hand.</p>
<p>That night in your bedroom, wow, quite an act. The tears were</p>
<p>almost convincing.”</p>
<p>I could see his mind spinning, trying to figure out how much I</p>
<p>knew. “I did lie,” he said at last. “I was trying to keep you out of</p>
<p>the middle of things. You don’t want to get mixed up with the</p>
<p>Black Hand.”</p>
<p>“Too late. He killed my dad.”</p>
<p>“Your dad isn’t the only one the Black Hand wants dead. He</p>
<p>wants me dead, Nora. I need the ring.” Suddenly he was on the</p>
<p>fifth step.</p>
<p>Dead? The Black Hand couldn’t kill Scott. He was immortal.</p>
<p>Did Scott think I didn’t know? And why was he so intent on</p>
<p>getting the ring back? I thought he despised his branding. A</p>
<p>new piece of information rose to the surface of my mind. “The</p>
<p>Black Hand didn’t force you to get the branding mark, did he?” I</p>
<p>said. “You wanted it. You wanted to join the society. You wanted</p>
<p>to swear allegiance. That’s why you kept the ring. It’s a sacred</p>
<p>token, isn’t it? Did the Black Hand give it to you after he finished</p>
<p>branding you?”</p>
<p>His hand flexed around the banister. “No. Iwas forced.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe you.”</p>
<p>His eyes narrowed. “Do you think I’d let some psychopath</p>
<p>grind a burning hot ring into my chest? If I’m so proud of the</p>
<p>branding, why am I always covering it up?”</p>
<p>“Because it’s a secret society. I’m sure you thought a</p>
<p>branding was a small price to pay for the benefits that come</p>
<p>with being part of a powerful society.”</p>
<p>“Benefits? You think the Black Hand has done a single thing</p>
<p>for me?” His tone was cut with anger. “He’s the Grim Reaper. I</p>
<p>can’t escape him, and trust me, I’ve tried. More times than I can</p>
<p>count.”</p>
<p>I absorbed this, catching Scott in another lie. “He came</p>
<p>back,” I said, speaking my thoughts aloud. “After he branded</p>
<p>you. You lied when you said you never saw him again.”</p>
<p>“Of course he came back!” Scott snapped. “He’d call late at</p>
<p>night, or sneak up on me on my way home from work, wearing a</p>
<p>ski mask. He was always there.”</p>
<p>“What did he want?”</p>
<p>His eyes gauged me. “If I talk, will you give the ring back?”</p>
<p>“Depends if I think you’re telling the truth.”</p>
<p>Scott scrubbed his knuckles furiously over his head. “The first</p>
<p>time I saw him was on my fourteenth birthday. He said I wasn’t</p>
<p>human. He said I was Nephilim, like him. He said I had to join</p>
<p>this group he belonged to. He said all Nephilim had to band</p>
<p>together. He said there was no other way we could free</p>
<p>ourselves from the fallen angels.” Scott glared up the stairs at</p>
<p>me, defiant, but his eyes held a shadow of wariness, as if he</p>
<p>thought Imight think he was crazy. “I thought he’d lost it. I thought</p>
<p>he was hallucinating. I kept dodging him, but he kept coming</p>
<p>back. He started threatening me. He said the fallen angels</p>
<p>would get me once I turned sixteen. He’d follow me around,</p>
<p>after school and work. He said he was watching my back, and I</p>
<p>should be grateful. Then he found out about my gambling debts.</p>
<p>He paid them off, thinking I’d see it as a favor and want to join</p>
<p>his group. He didn’t get it—Iwanted him to go away. When I told</p>
<p>him I was going to get my dad to slap a restraining order on</p>
<p>him, he hauled me into the warehouse, tied me down, and</p>
<p>branded me. He said it was the only way he could keep me</p>
<p>safe. He said that someday I’d understand and I’d thank him.”</p>
<p>The tone of Scott’s voice told me that day was never going to</p>
<p>come.</p>
<p>“Sounds like he’s obsessed with you.”</p>
<p>Scott shook his head. “He thinks I betrayed him. My mom</p>
<p>and I moved here to get away from him. She doesn’t know</p>
<p>about the Nephilim stuff, or the branding, she just thinks he’s a</p>
<p>stalker. We moved, but he doesn’t want me running off, and he</p>
<p>especially doesn’t want to risk having me open my mouth and</p>
<p>blow the cover on his secret cult.”</p>
<p>“Does he know you’re in Coldwater?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. That’s why I need the ring. When he finished</p>
<p>branding me, he gave me the ring. He said I had to keep it and</p>
<p>find other members to recruit. He told me not to lose it. He said</p>
<p>something bad would happen if I did.” Scott’s voice shook</p>
<p>slightly. “He’s crazy, Nora. He could do all kinds of things to me.”</p>
<p>“You have to help me find him.”</p>
<p>He advanced two more steps. “Forget it. I’m not going</p>
<p>looking for him.” He reached his hand out. “Now give me the</p>
<p>ring. Stop stalling. I know it’s here.”</p>
<p>For no reason other than instinct, I turned and ran. I slammed</p>
<p>the bathroom door shut behind me and punched the lock.</p>
<p>“This is getting old,” Scott said through the door. “Open up.”</p>
<p>He waited. “You think this door is going to stop me?”</p>
<p>I didn’t, but I didn’t know what else to do. I was pressed</p>
<p>against the back wall of the bathroom, and that was when I saw</p>
<p>the paring knife on the counter. I kept it in the bathroom to open</p>
<p>cosmetic packages and to easily remove tags from my clothes.</p>
<p>I picked it up, pointing the blade out.</p>
<p>I picked it up, pointing the blade out.</p>
<p>Scott rammed his body against the door, and it banged</p>
<p>open, slamming back against the wall. We were standing face-to-face, and I leveled the knife at him.</p>
<p>Scott walked up to me, yanked the knife out of my grasp, and</p>
<p>redirected it at me. “Who’s in charge now?” he sneered.</p>
<p>The hallway behind Scott was dark, light from the bathroom</p>
<p>illuminating the faded flower wallpaper in the hall. The shadow</p>
<p>moved so stealthily across the wallpaper, I almost missed it.</p>
<p>Rixon appeared behind Scott, holding the base of the brass</p>
<p>lamp my mom kept on the entryway table. He brought the lamp</p>
<p>down on Scott’s skull in a crushing blow.</p>
<p>“Oouf!” Scott blubbered, staggering around to see what had</p>
<p>hit him. In what looked like a jerk of reflex, he yanked the knife</p>
<p>up and sliced blindly.</p>
<p>The knife missed, and Rixon slammed the lamp down on</p>
<p>Scott’s arm, causing him to drop the knife at the same moment</p>
<p>that he collapsed sideways into the wall. Rixon kicked the knife</p>
<p>down the hall, out of reach. He rammed his fist into Scott’s face.</p>
<p>A spray of blood flecked the wall. Rixon threw a second punch,</p>
<p>and Scott’s back dragged down the wall until he sat slumped on</p>
<p>the floor. Gripping Scott’s collar, Rixon uprighted him long</p>
<p>enough to deliver a third punch. Scott’s eyes rolled back in his</p>
<p>head.</p>
<p>“Rixon!”</p>
<p>I jerked away from the violence at the sound of Vee’s</p>
<p>hysterical voice. She hiked up the stairs, using the banister to</p>
<p>pull herself faster. “Stop, Rixon! You’re going to kill him!”</p>
<p>Rixon let go of Scott’s collar and stepped away. “Patch would</p>
<p>kill me if I didn’t.” He turned his attention to me. “You okay?”</p>
<p>Scott’s face was splattered with blood, and it made my</p>
<p>stomach roll. “I’m fine,” I said numbly.</p>
<p>“You sure? You need something to drink? A blanket? You</p>
<p>want to lie down?”</p>
<p>I looked between Rixon and Vee. “What are we going to do</p>
<p>now?”</p>
<p>“I’m going to call Patch,” Rixon said, flipping his cell open</p>
<p>and pressing it to his ear. “He’s going to want to be here for</p>
<p>this.”</p>
<p>Iwas too much in shock to argue otherwise.</p>
<p>“We should call the cops,” Vee said. She stole a brief look at</p>
<p>Scott’s unconscious and battered body. “Should we tie him up?</p>
<p>What if he wakes up and tries to get away?”</p>
<p>“I’ll tie him in the back of the truck as soon as I finish this call,”</p>
<p>Rixon said.</p>
<p>“Come here, babe,” said Vee, pulling me into her arms. She</p>
<p>guided me down the stairs, her arm curled around my shoulder.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I answered automatically, still in a daze. “How did you</p>
<p>guys get here?”</p>
<p>“Rixon came over, and we were hanging out in my bedroom</p>
<p>when I got one of those creepy feelings that we should check on</p>
<p>you. When we pulled up, Scott’s Mustang was parked in the</p>
<p>driveway. I figured his being here couldn’t be good, especially</p>
<p>since we’d been snooping around his bedroom. I told Rixon</p>
<p>something was wrong, and he told me to wait in the car while he</p>
<p>something was wrong, and he told me to wait in the car while he</p>
<p>went in. I’m just glad we made it before something worse</p>
<p>happened. Holy freak show. What was he thinking, pulling a</p>
<p>knife on you?”</p>
<p>Before I could tell her I’d pulled the knife first, Rixon jogged</p>
<p>downstairs, joining us in the foyer. “I left a message for Patch,”</p>
<p>he said. “He should be here soon. I also called the cops.”</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, Detective Basso braked at the bottom</p>
<p>of the driveway, a Kojak light flashing on the roof of his car.</p>
<p>Scott was slowly regaining consciousness, stirring and</p>
<p>groaning in the bed of Rixon’s truck. His face was a swollen,</p>
<p>blotchy mess, and his hands were roped at his lower back.</p>
<p>Detective Basso hauled him out and swapped the rope for</p>
<p>handcuffs.</p>
<p>“I didn’t do anything,” Scott protested, his lip a blubbery mess</p>
<p>of blood and tissue.</p>
<p>“Breaking and entering is nothing?” Detective Basso</p>
<p>echoed. “Funny, the law disagrees.”</p>
<p>“She stole something from me.” Scott jerked his chin in my</p>
<p>direction. “Ask her. She was in my bedroom earlier tonight.”</p>
<p>“What did she steal?”</p>
<p>“I—I can’t talk about it.”</p>
<p>Detective Basso looked to me for confirmation.</p>
<p>“She’s been with us all night,” Vee inserted quickly. “Right,</p>
<p>Rixon?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely,” Rixon said.</p>
<p>Scott nailed me with a look of betrayal. “Not so goody-twoshoes</p>
<p>now, are you?”</p>
<p>Detective Basso ignored him. “Let’s talk about this knife you</p>
<p>pulled.”</p>
<p>“She pulled it first!”</p>
<p>“You broke into my house,” I said. “Self-defense.”</p>
<p>“Iwant a lawyer,” Scott said.</p>
<p>Detective Basso smiled, but there was no patience in it. “A</p>
<p>lawyer? You sound guilty, Scott. Why’d you try to knife her?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t try to knife her. I took the knife out of her hand. She</p>
<p>was the one trying to knife me.”</p>
<p>“He’s a good liar, I’ll give him that,” Rixon said.</p>
<p>“You’re under arrest, Scott Parnell,” Detective Basso said,</p>
<p>ducking Scott’s head as he directed him into the backseat of</p>
<p>the patrol car. “You have the right to remain silent. Anything you</p>
<p>say can and will be used against you.”</p>
<p>Scott kept his expression hostile, but beneath all the cuts and</p>
<p>bruises, he seemed to pale. “You’re making a big mistake,” he</p>
<p>said, only he was looking right at me. “If I go to jail, I’m like a rat</p>
<p>in a cage. He’ll find me and kill me. The Black Hand will.”</p>
<p>He sounded genuinely terrified, and I was torn between</p>
<p>silently congratulating him on a well-delivered act … and</p>
<p>thinking maybe he really had no idea what he was capable of</p>
<p>as Nephilim. But how could he be branded into a Nephilim</p>
<p>blood society and have no clue that he was immortal? How</p>
<p>could the society have failed to mention that?</p>
<p>Scott didn’t move his eyes from mine. Adopting a pleading</p>
<p>tone, he said, “This is it, Nora. If I leave here, I’m dead.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah,” Detective Basso said, shutting the door hard.</p>
<p>He turned to me. “Think you could stay out of trouble the rest of</p>

<p></p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>I RAISED MY BEDROOM WINDOW AND SAT ON THE LEDGE, thinking. A</p>
<p>refreshing breeze and a night chorus of insects kept me</p>
<p>company. At the far end of the field, a light blinked on in one of</p>
<p>the houses. It felt strangely reassuring to know I wasn’t the only</p>
<p>person still awake at this hour.</p>
<p>After Detective Basso had driven away with Scott, Vee and</p>
<p>Rixon had examined the lock on the front door.</p>
<p>“Whoa,” Vee had said, staring at the mangled door. “How did</p>
<p>Scott get the deadbolt to bend like that? A blowtorch?”</p>
<p>Rixon and I had merely looked at each other.</p>
<p>“I’ll stop by tomorrow and install a new lock,” he’d said.</p>
<p>That had been over two hours ago, and Rixon and Vee were</p>
<p>long gone, leaving me alone with my own thoughts. I didn’t want</p>
<p>to think about Scott but found my mind straying there anyway. Was he overreacting, or was I going to find out tomorrow that</p>
<p>he’d been mysteriously roughed up while in police custody?</p>
<p>Either way, he wouldn’t die. A few bruises, maybe, but not</p>
<p>death. I didn’t allow myself to think the Black Hand might take it</p>
<p>further than that—if the Black Hand was even a threat. Scott</p>
<p>wasn’t even sure the Black Hand knew he was in Coldwater.</p>
<p>Instead I told myself there was nothing I could do at this point.</p>
<p>Scott had broken into my house and pointed a knife at me. He</p>
<p>was behind bars because of himself. He was locked up, and I</p>
<p>was safe. The irony was, I wished I could be at the jail tonight. If</p>
<p>Scott was bait for the Black Hand, I wanted to be there to face</p>
<p>the Black Hand once and for all.</p>
<p>My concentration was dulled by the need for sleep, but I did</p>
<p>my best to sort through the information I had. Scott was branded</p>
<p>by the Black Hand, a Nephil. Rixon said Patch was the Black</p>
<p>Hand, an angel. It almost seemed like I was looking for two</p>
<p>different individuals sharing the same name….</p>
<p>The hour had stretched long past midnight, but I didn’t want</p>
<p>to sleep. Not when it meant opening myself up to Patch, feeling</p>
<p>his net close around me, seducing me with words and his silky</p>
<p>touch, confusing me more than I already was. More than sleep, I</p>
<p>wanted answers. I still hadn’t been to Patch’s apartment, and</p>
<p>more than ever, I felt certain that was where the answers were.</p>
<p>I tugged on dark-wash matchstick jeans and a black fitted</p>
<p>tee. Because the forecast called for rain, I opted for tennis</p>
<p>shoes and my waterproof Windbreaker.</p>
<p>I took a taxi to the easternmost edge of Coldwater. The river</p>
<p>shimmered like a wide black snake. The outline of factory</p>
<p>chimneys beyond the river played tricks in the night, making me</p>
<p>think of hulking monsters if I looked at them from the corner of</p>
<p>my vision. When I’d walked to the five hundred block of the</p>
<p>industrial district, I found two apartment buildings, both three</p>
<p>stories high. I let myself into the lobby of the first building. All</p>
<p>was quiet, and I assumed the tenants were tucked in their beds.</p>
<p>I checked the mailboxes in the back, but there was no listing for</p>
<p>Cipriano. Not that Patch would be careless enough to leave his</p>
<p>name behind, if he really was going to great lengths to keep his</p>
<p>place off the radar. I climbed the stairs to the top. Apartments</p>
<p>3A, B, and C. No apartment 34. I jogged down the steps,</p>
<p>walked a half block down, and tried the second building.</p>
<p>Behind the main doors sat a cramped lobby with scuffed tiles</p>
<p>and a thin coat of paint barely masking red and black graffiti.</p>
<p>Just like the previous building, mailboxes stood in a line at the</p>
<p>back. Near the front, the air conditioner rattled and buzzed while</p>
<p>the door to an old cage elevator stood open like mesh jaws</p>
<p>waiting to snap me up. I bypassed the elevator in favor of the</p>
<p>stairs. The building had a lonely, derelict feel to it. A place</p>
<p>where neighbors minded their own business. A place where</p>
<p>nobody knew anyone else, and secrets were easy to keep.</p>
<p>The third floor was dead calm. I walked past apartments 31,</p>
<p>32, and 33. At the back of the hall I found apartment number 34.</p>
<p>I suddenly wondered what Iwas going to do if Patch was home.</p>
<p>At this point, I could only hope he wasn’t. I knocked, but there</p>
<p>was no answer. I tried the door handle. To my surprise, it gave.</p>
<p>I peeked inside at darkness. I stood motionless, listening for</p>
<p>movement.</p>
<p>I flipped on the light switch just inside the door, but either the</p>
<p>lightbulbs had burned out or the electricity had been shut off.</p>
<p>Pulling the flashlight out of my jacket, I let myself in and shut the</p>
<p>door.</p>
<p>The rancid smell of spoiled food overwhelmed me. I aimed</p>
<p>the flashlight in the direction of the kitchen. A skillet with days-</p>
<p>the flashlight in the direction of the kitchen. A skillet with daysold</p>
<p>scrambled eggs and a partially full gallon of milk that had</p>
<p>soured to the point of bloating sat on the counter. It wasn’t the</p>
<p>kind of place I imagined Patch calling home, but this only</p>
<p>proved there were many things I didn’t know about him.</p>
<p>I set my keys and handbag on the counter and pulled my shirt</p>
<p>up over my nose in an attempt to block out the stench. The walls</p>
<p>were bare, the furniture sparse. One antiquated TV with rabbit</p>
<p>ears, probably black and white, and a ratty sofa in the living</p>
<p>room. Both were out of view of the window, which had butcher</p>
<p>paper taped across it.</p>
<p>Keeping the flashlight beam low, I made my way down the</p>
<p>hall to the bathroom. It was stark, other than a beige shower</p>
<p>curtain that had probably started out white, and a dingy hotel</p>
<p>towel draped over the rod. No soap, no razor, no shaving</p>
<p>cream. The linoleum floor was peeling back at the edges, and</p>
<p>the medicine cabinet over the sink was empty.</p>
<p>I continued down the hall to the bedroom. I turned the knob</p>
<p>and pushed the door inward. The stale smell of sweat and</p>
<p>unwashed bed clung to the air. Since the lights were off, I</p>
<p>figured it was safe to raise the blinds, and I forced the window</p>
<p>open, allowing fresh air inside. A streetlight’s glow trickled in,</p>
<p>casting a hazy gray around the room.</p>
<p>Dishes caked with dried food were stacked on the</p>
<p>nightstand, and while the bed had sheets, they lacked the crisp</p>
<p>look of freshly laundered linens. In fact, judging by the smell,</p>
<p>they hadn’t seen laundry soap in months. A small desk with a</p>
<p>computer monitor sat in the back corner. The actual computer</p>
<p>was gone, and it occurred to me that Patch had taken great</p>
<p>care not to leave any trace of himself behind.</p>
<p>I crouched in front of the desk, opening and closing drawers.</p>
<p>Nothing struck me as out of the ordinary: pencils, and a copy of</p>
<p>the Yellow Pages. I was about to close the door when a small</p>
<p>black jewelry box taped to the underside of the desk caught my</p>
<p>eye. I ran my hand under the desk, blindly peeling the box free</p>
<p>from the tape holding it in place. I lifted the lid. Every hair on my</p>
<p>body stood on end.</p>
<p>The box held six of the Black Hand’s rings.</p>
<p>At the far end of the hall, the front door creaked open.</p>
<p>I shot to my feet. Had Patch returned? I couldn’t let him find</p>
<p>me. Not now, not when I’d just discovered the Black Hand’s</p>
<p>rings in his apartment.</p>
<p>I looked around for somewhere to hide. The twin-size bed</p>
<p>stood between me and the closet. If I tried to walk around the</p>
<p>bed, I risked being seen from the doorway. If I climbed over the</p>
<p>bed, Irisked the bedsprings squeaking.</p>
<p>The front door closed with a soft click. Solid footsteps</p>
<p>crossed the linoleum in the kitchen. Seeing no other choice, I</p>
<p>boosted myself onto the windowsill, swung my legs out, and</p>
<p>dropped as silently as possible onto the fire escape. I tried to</p>
<p>pull the window shut behind me, but the sliders stuck, refusing to</p>
<p>budge. I ducked all but my eyes below the window, keeping</p>
<p>them trained inside the apartment.</p>
<p>A shadow appeared on the hall wall, stretching closer. I</p>
<p>ducked out of sight.</p>
<p>I was scared that this was it—I was going to be caught</p>
<p>I was scared that this was it—I was going to be caught —when the footsteps retreated. Less than a minute later, the</p>
<p>front door opened, closed. An eerie silence once again settled</p>
<p>over the apartment.</p>
<p>Slowly I brought myself back to standing. I stayed that way</p>
<p>another minute, and when I was certain the apartment was in</p>
<p>fact empty, I crawled back inside. Feeling suddenly</p>
<p>conspicuous and vulnerable, I strode down the hall. I needed to</p>
<p>go somewhere quiet, where I could sort through my thoughts. What was Imissing? Patch was clearly the Black Hand, but how</p>
<p>did he play into the Nephilim blood society? What was his role?</p>
<p>What the hell was going on? I threw my handbag over my</p>
<p>shoulder and headed for the exit.</p>
<p>I had my hand on the doorknob when a strange noise</p>
<p>penetrated my thoughts. A clock. The soft, rhythmic tick of a</p>
<p>clock. I frowned and turned back to the kitchen. The sound</p>
<p>hadn’t been there when I came in—at least, I didn’t think it had.</p>
<p>Listening intently, I followed the muffled tick across the room. I</p>
<p>crouched down in front of the cabinet below the kitchen sink. With growing alarm, I opened the cabinet. Through all the</p>
<p>panic and confusion, I made sense of the contraption sitting</p>
<p>inches from my knees. Sticks of dynamite. Duct tape. White,</p>
<p>blue, and yellow wires.</p>
<p>I stumbled to my feet and ran out the front door. My feet</p>
<p>clattered down the stairs so fast I had to hold the handrail to</p>
<p>keep from falling. At the bottom, I shoved my way out to the</p>
<p>street and kept running. Flipping my head back once, I saw a</p>
<p>snap of light an instant before fire erupted from the windows of</p>
<p>the third floor of the building. Smoke billowed up in the night.</p>
<p>Debris of bricks and wood, glowing orange with heat, hailed</p>
<p>down to the street.</p>
<p>The far-away sound of sirens ricocheted off the buildings,</p>
<p>and I alternately speed-walked and ran to the next block,</p>
<p>terrified of drawing attention, but too distraught not to flee the</p>
<p>scene. When I rounded the corner, I broke into a wild sprint. I</p>
<p>didn’t know where I was going. My pulse was all over the place,</p>
<p>my thoughts reeling. If I’d stayed in the apartment another few</p>
<p>minutes, I’d be dead.</p>
<p>A shuddering sob escaped me. My nose was running, my</p>
<p>stomach cramping. I wiped my eyes with the back of my hand</p>
<p>and tried to focus on the shapes jumping out of the darkness</p>
<p>ahead: street signs, parked cars, the curb—the deceptive</p>
<p>shimmer of lamplight on windows. In a matter of seconds, the</p>
<p>world had turned into a confusing labyrinth; the truth there and</p>
<p>not there, shifting out beneath my feet, vanishing when I tried to</p>
<p>look it head-on.</p>
<p>Had someone tried to blow up evidence left in the</p>
<p>apartment? Like the Black Hand’s rings? Was Patch</p>
<p>responsible?</p>
<p>Ahead, a gas station came into view. I staggered around to</p>
<p>the outside bathroom and locked myself inside. My legs were</p>
<p>wobbly, and my fingers trembled so hard it was all I could do to</p>
<p>coordinate turning on the faucet. I splashed frigid water on my</p>
<p>face to startle me out of sliding into shock. Bracing my arms on</p>
<p>the sink, I breathed in gulps and gasps.</p><p>

<p></p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>I HADN’T SLEPT IN OVER THIRTY-SIX HOURS, EXCEPT FOR very briefly</p>
<p>Thursday evening, when Patch had met me inside my dream.</p>
<p>Staying awake through the night hadn’t been a struggle;</p>
<p>every time I felt my eyes dipping closed, the explosion would</p>
<p>blaze across my mind, jolting me upright. Unable to sleep, I’d</p>
<p>spent the night thinking about Patch. When Rixon had told me Patch was the Black Hand, he’d</p>
<p>planted a seed of doubt inside me that had swollen and</p>
<p>blossomed with the worst kind of violation of trust, but it hadn’t</p>
<p>choked me completely. Not yet. There was still a part of me that</p>
<p>wanted to weep and shake my head adamantly at the idea that</p>
<p>Patch could have killed my dad. I bit my lip hard, concentrating</p>
<p>on the pain there, rather than remembering all the times he’d</p>
<p>stroked my mouth with his finger, or kissed the curve of my ear. I</p>
<p>couldn’t think about those things.</p>
<p>I hadn’t bothered crawling out of bed at seven for summer</p>
<p>school. I’d left a series of phone messages for Detective Basso</p>
<p>throughout the morning, then the afternoon, and on into the</p>
<p>evening, one call every hour, none of which he’d returned. I told</p>
<p>myself I was calling to check on Scott, but deep down, I</p>
<p>suspected I just wanted to know the police were close. As much</p>
<p>as I disliked Detective Basso, I felt a tiny bit safer believing he</p>
<p>was only a phone call away. Because a small part of me was</p>
<p>beginning to believe maybe last night wasn’t about destroying</p>
<p>evidence. What if someone had tried to kill me?</p>
<p>In the middle of all the thinking I’d done last night, I’d shifted</p>
<p>around the fragments of information I had, trying to make</p>
<p>something fit. The one clear fragment I kept coming back to</p>
<p>was the Nephilim blood society. Patch said Chauncey’s</p>
<p>successor wanted to avenge his death. Patch swore nobody</p>
<p>could trace Chauncey’s death back to me, but I was beginning</p>
<p>to fear otherwise. If the successor knew about me, maybe last</p>
<p>night had been his first stab at revenge.</p>
<p>It seemed unlikely that anyone had followed me to Patch’s</p>
<p>apartment so late last night, but if there was one thing I knew</p>
<p>about Nephilim, it was that they were very good at doing the</p>
<p>unlikely.</p>
<p>My cell rang in my pocket and I whipped it out before the first</p>
<p>ring had time to finish.</p>
<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>“Let’s go to Summer Solstice,” Vee said. “We’ll eat a little</p>
<p>cotton candy, catch a few rides, maybe get hypnotized and do</p>
<p>stuff that would make Girls Gone Wild look tame.”</p>
<p>My heart, which had been up in my throat, slid back into</p>
<p>place. Not Detective Basso, then. “Hey.”</p>
<p>“What say you? You in the mood for some action? You in the</p>
<p>mood for Delphic?”</p>
<p>Honestly, I wasn’t. I’d planned on redialing Detective Basso</p>
<p>at sixty-minute intervals until he picked up one of my calls.</p>
<p>“Earth to babe.”</p>
<p>“I’m not feeling well,” I said.</p>
<p>“Not feeling well how? Stomachache? Headache? Cramps?</p>
<p>Food poisoning? Delphic is the cure for just about all those</p>
<p>things.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to pass, thanks anyway.”</p>
<p>“Is this because of Scott? Because he’s in jail. He can’t get</p>
<p>to you. Come have fun. Rixon and I won’t kiss in front of you, if</p>
<p>that’s what’s bothering you.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to put on my pj’s and watch a movie.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying a movie is more fun than me?”</p>
<p>“Tonight it is.”</p>
<p>“Huh. Movie this. You know I’m not going to stop harassing</p>
<p>you until you come.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“So make this easy and just say yes.”</p>
<p>I blew out a sigh. I could sit home all night and wait for</p>
<p>Detective Basso to get around to answering my calls, or I could</p>
<p>take a small break and start up again when I got back. Besides,</p>
<p>he had my cell phone number and could reach me anywhere.</p>
<p>“All right,” I told Vee. “Give me ten.”</p>
<p>In my bedroom, I squeezed into a pair of toothpick jeans,</p>
<p>pulled on a graphic tee and cardigan, and finished the look with</p>
<p>suede driving mocs. I smoothed my hair into a low ponytail,</p>
<p>offsetting it so it hung over my right shoulder. Having not slept in</p>
<p>more than a full day, my eyes were ringed by smoky circles. I</p>
<p>more than a full day, my eyes were ringed by smoky circles. I</p>
<p>brushed on mascara, silver eye shadow, and lip gloss, hoping I</p>
<p>looked more pulled-together than I felt. I left a rather bland note</p>
<p>on the kitchen counter for my mom, telling her I’d gone to</p>
<p>Summer Solstice at Delphic. She wasn’t due back until</p>
<p>tomorrow morning, but she surprised me more often than not by</p>
<p>coming home early. If she did make it home tonight, this was</p>
<p>probably going to be one time when she wished she’d drawn</p>
<p>out her trip. I’d been practicing what I was going to say to her. Whatever I did, I couldn’t break eye contact when I told her I</p>
<p>knew about her affair with Hank.And I couldn’t let her get a word</p>
<p>in before I told her I was moving out. As I’d practiced it, I</p>
<p>planned to walk out at that point. I wanted to send her the</p>
<p>message that it was too late to talk—if she’d wanted to tell me</p>
<p>the truth, she’d had sixteen years to do it. Now it was too late.</p>
<p>I locked up and jogged down the drive to meet Vee.</p>
<p>An hour later, Vee squeezed the Neon into a parking spot</p>
<p>between two oversize trucks that extended into our space on</p>
<p>both sides. We rolled down the windows and boosted ourselves</p>
<p>out backward to keep from scratching the paint by opening the</p>
<p>doors. We crossed the parking lot and paid our way inside the</p>
<p>gates. The park was more crowded than usual due to Summer</p>
<p>Solstice—the longest day of the year. Right away I recognized a</p>
<p>few faces from school, but for the most part, I felt like I was</p>
<p>standing in a sea of strangers. Most of the crowd was wearing</p>
<p>jewel-toned butterfly masks that concealed half their faces. One</p>
<p>of the vendors must have been selling them at a discount.</p>
<p>“Where should we start?” Vee asked. “The arcade? The fun</p>
<p>house? The food vendors? Personally, I think we should start</p>
<p>with the food. That way, we’ll eat less.”</p>
<p>“Your logic?”</p>
<p>“If we stop by the vendors last, we’ll have worked up our</p>
<p>appetites. I always eat more when I’ve worked up an appetite.”</p>
<p>I didn’t care where we started. I was only here to distract</p>
<p>myself for a couple of hours. I checked my cell, but there were</p>
<p>no missed calls. How long did it take Detective Basso to return</p>
<p>a call? Had something happened to him? I had a black cloud</p>
<p>hanging at the back of my mind, and I didn’t like how it made</p>
<p>me feel ill at ease.</p>
<p>“You look all pasty,” Vee said.</p>
<p>“I told you: I don’t feel great.”</p>
<p>“That’s because you haven’t eaten enough. Sit down. I’ll go</p>
<p>get us some cotton candy and hot dogs. Just think about all that</p>
<p>relish and mustard. I don’t know about you, but I can already feel</p>
<p>my head clearing and my pulse slowing.”</p>
<p>“I’m not hungry, Vee.”</p>
<p>“Of course you’re hungry. Everybody’s hungry. That’s why</p>
<p>they’ve got all these vendors.” Before I could stop her, she</p>
<p>marched into the crowd.</p>
<p>I was pacing the walkway, waiting for Vee, when my cell</p>
<p>phone chirped. Detective Basso’s name showed on the screen.</p>
<p>“Finally,” I breathed, flipping the cell open.</p>
<p>“Nora, where are you?” he said the moment I picked up. He</p>
<p>was speaking fast, and I could tell he was upset. “Scott</p>
<p>escaped. He got away. We’ve got the whole force looking for</p>
<p>him, but I want you to stay the hell away from him. I’m coming to</p>
<p>pick you up until this blows over. I’m on my way to your house</p>
<p>right now.”</p>
<p>My throat constricted, making it hard to force words out.</p>
<p>“What? How did he get out?”</p>
<p>Detective Basso hesitated before answering. “He bent the</p>
<p>bars in his cell.”</p>
<p>Of course he did. He was Nephilim. Two months ago I’d</p>
<p>watched Chauncey mangle my cell phone with a mere squeeze</p>
<p>of his hand. It didn’t seem too unrealistic to imagine Scott using</p>
<p>his Nephilim strength to break out of jail.</p>
<p>“I’m not at home,” I said. “I’m at Delphic amusement park.” Without meaning to, I cast my eyes over the crowd, looking for</p>
<p>Scott. But there was no way he could know I was here. After</p>
<p>breaking out of jail, he’d probably gone directly to my house,</p>
<p>expecting to find me there. I felt incredibly grateful to Vee for</p>
<p>dragging me out tonight. Scott was probably at my house right</p>
<p>this very minute—</p>
<p>The cell slipped a notch through my hand. The note. On the</p>
<p>counter. The one I’d left for my mom, telling her I’d gone to</p>
<p>Delphic.</p>
<p>“I think he knows where I am,” I told Detective Basso, feeling</p>
<p>the first licks of panic. “How soon can you get here?”</p>
<p>“Delphic? Thirty minutes. Go to security. Whatever you do,</p>
<p>keep your phone on you. If you see Scott, call me immediately.”</p>
<p>“They don’t have security at Delphic,” I said, my mouth gone</p>
<p>to dust. It was widely known that the park didn’t employ security,</p>
<p>which was one of many reasons why my mom didn’t like me</p>
<p>coming here.</p>
<p>“Then get out of there,” he barked. “Drive back to Coldwater</p>
<p>and meet me at the station. Can you do that?”</p>
<p>Yes. I could do that. Vee would give me a ride. I was already</p>
<p>walking in the direction she’d departed, eyes raking the crowd</p>
<p>for her.</p>
<p>Detective Basso exhaled. “You’re going to be fine. Just …</p>
<p>hurry back here. I’ll send the rest of the force to Delphic to go</p>
<p>after Scott. We’ll find him.” The anxiety in his voice didn’t</p>
<p>console me.</p>
<p>I hung up. Scott was out. The police were on their way, and</p>
<p>this was all going to end fine … as long as I got out now. I</p>
<p>sketched a quick plan. First, I had to find Vee. I also had to get</p>
<p>out of the open. If Scott came walking down the path right this</p>
<p>moment, he would see me.</p>
<p>I was jogging toward the food vendors when my ribs were</p>
<p>elbowed from behind. Something about the force of the</p>
<p>elbowing told me this was more than an accident. I turned, and</p>
<p>before I’d come full circle, my brain prickled as it registered a</p>
<p>familiar face. The first thing I noticed was the flash from the</p>
<p>silver hoop in his ear. The second thing I noticed was how beatup</p>
<p>his face was. His nose was broken—crooked and bruised</p>
<p>deep red. The bruise spread below both eyes, turning a deep</p>
<p>violet.</p>
<p>The next thing I knew, Scott had me by the elbow and was</p>
<p>steering me down the walkway.</p>
<p>“Get your hands off me,” I said, wrestling against him. But</p>
<p>“Get your hands off me,” I said, wrestling against him. But</p>
<p>Scott was stronger, and his grip held.</p>
<p>“Sure, Nora, after you tell me where it is.”</p>
<p>“Where what is?” I said, my voice passive-aggressive.</p>
<p>He laughed humorlessly.</p>
<p>I kept my expression as opaque as I could, but my thoughts</p>
<p>were racing. If I told him the ring was at my home, he’d leave the</p>
<p>park. He’d probably drag me with him. When the police arrived,</p>
<p>they’d find us both gone. It wasn’t like I could call Detective</p>
<p>Basso and tell him we were headed to my place. Not with Scott</p>
<p>standing over me. No, I had to keep him here, in the park.</p>
<p>“Did you give it to Vee’s boyfriend? Did you think he could</p>
<p>protect it from me? I know he’s not—normal.” Scott’s eyes held</p>
<p>that same terrified uncertainty. “I know he can do things other</p>
<p>people can’t.”</p>
<p>“Like you?”</p>
<p>Scott glared down at me. “He’s not like me. He’s not the</p>
<p>same. That much I can tell. I’m not going to hurt you, Nora. All I</p>
<p>need is the ring. Give it to me, and you’ll never see me again.”</p>
<p>He was lying. He would hurt me. He was desperate enough</p>
<p>to break out of jail. Nothing was too extreme at this point—he</p>
<p>would get the ring back, no matter the cost. Adrenaline pumped</p>
<p>through my legs and I couldn’t think clearly. But somewhere in</p>
<p>the back of my mind, my sense of survival told me I needed to</p>
<p>take charge of the situation. I needed to find a way to separate</p>
<p>myself from Scott. Blindly following my instincts, I said, “I have</p>
<p>the ring.”</p>
<p>“I know you have it,” he said impatiently. “Where?”</p>
<p>“It’s here. I brought it with me.”</p>
<p>He considered me for a moment, then yanked my handbag</p>
<p>off my arm and ripped it open, searching it.</p>
<p>I shook my head. “I threw it away.”</p>
<p>He shoved the handbag back at me, and I caught it, clutching</p>
<p>it against my chest. “Where?” he demanded.</p>
<p>“A trash can near the entrance,” I said automatically. “Inside</p>
<p>one of the women’s restrooms.”</p>
<p>“Show me.”</p>
<p>As we made our way down the walkway, I ordered myself to</p>
<p>stay calm long enough to figure out my next move. Could I run?</p>
<p>No, Scott would catch me. Could I hide out in one of the</p>
<p>women’s restrooms? Not indefinitely, no. Scott wasn’t timid,</p>
<p>and he wouldn’t have a problem going in after me if it meant</p>
<p>getting what he wanted. I still had my cell phone, however. In the</p>
<p>women’s room, I could call Detective Basso.</p>
<p>“This one,” I said, pointing at one of the cinderblock shelters.</p>
<p>The entrance to the women’s room was straight ahead, down a</p>
<p>sloping stretch of cement, with the men’s room around the back.</p>
<p>Scott grabbed me by the shoulders and shook me. “Don’t lie</p>
<p>to me. They’ll kill me if I lose it. If you’re lying to me, I’ll …” He</p>
<p>caught himself, but I knew what he’d been about to say. If you’re</p>
<p>lying to me, I’ll kill you.</p>
<p>“It’s in the bathroom.” I nodded, more to convince myself I</p>
<p>could do this than to reassure him. “I’ll go get it. And then you’ll</p>
<p>leave me alone, right?”</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Scott shoved out a hand, catching me</p>
<p>in the navel. “Your cell.”</p>
<p>My heart fumbled. Seeing no other choice, I retrieved my</p>
<p>phone and held it out to him. My hand shook slightly, but I</p>
<p>steadied it, refusing to let him know I’d had a plan, or that he’d</p>
<p>just shattered it.</p>
<p>“You’ve got one minute. Don’t try anything stupid.”</p>
<p>Inside the restroom, I made a quick survey. Five sinks</p>
<p>against one wall, and five stalls opposite them. Two college-age</p>
<p>girls were at the sinks, a foam of bubbles covering their hands.</p>
<p>There was a small window on the far wall, and it was cranked</p>
<p>open. Without eating up any more time, I got my foot up on the</p>
<p>last sink and pulled myself to standing. The window was level</p>
<p>with my elbows now, and while there wasn’t a screen to block</p>
<p>me, it was going to be a tight fit to squeeze through. I could feel</p>
<p>the eyes of everyone on me, but I ignored them and hoisted</p>
<p>myself up on the ledge, hardly aware of the splattered bird poop</p>
<p>or spiderwebs. When I pushed on the open windowpane, it popped free and</p>
<p>fell to the ground outside with a clatter. I sucked in a breath,</p>
<p>thinking Scott had heard, but the crowds out on the walkways</p>
<p>had stifled the sound. Propping my stomach on the windowsill, I</p>
<p>lifted my left leg up, cramming it against my body until Iwas able</p>
<p>to roll it through the window. I wiggled the rest of the way</p>
<p>through, my right leg sliding out last. I hung from the windowsill</p>
<p>by my fingers, then dropped to the sidewalk outside. I stayed in</p>
<p>a crouch a moment, half expecting Scott to round the building.</p>
<p>Then I ran toward the park’s main walkway and slipped</p>
<p>inside the stream of the crowd.</p>
<p>inside the stream of the crowd.</p><p>

<p></p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>DARKNESS WAS STRETCHING ACROSS THE SKY, eclipsing the pale</p>
<p>streaks of light fanning out from the horizon. I walked in a hurry</p>
<p>toward the park’s exit. I could see the gates ahead. Almost</p>
<p>there. Iwas pushing through the fringe of the crowd when I came</p>
<p>up short. Less than two hundred feet away, Scott was pacing</p>
<p>the gates, his eyes sweeping the crush of bodies pouring in and</p>
<p>out of the gates. He’d figured out I’d escaped the bathroom and</p>
<p>was blocking the only way out of the park. A high chain-link</p>
<p>fence topped with barbed wire encircled the park, and the only</p>
<p>way I was getting out was through the exit gates. I knew it, and</p>
<p>Scott knew it.</p>
<p>I turned abruptly and melted back into the crowd, checking</p>
<p>behind me every few seconds to make sure Scott hadn’t</p>
<p>spotted me.</p>
<p>Iworked my way deeper into the park on the assumption that</p>
<p>the last place I had seen Scott was at the gates, and it was in</p>
<p>my best interest to get as far away from them as I could. I could</p>
<p>hide in the darkness of the fun house until the police arrived, or I</p>
<p>could take the sky ride above the park, where I might be able to</p>
<p>see Scott below and keep an eye on him. As long as he didn’t</p>
<p>look up, I’d be fine. Of course, if he did see me, I had no doubt</p>
<p>he’d be waiting for me at the end of the ride. I decided to keep</p>
<p>moving, stay in the heaviest pockets of traffic, and wait this out.</p>
<p>The walkway split at the Ferris wheel, one path branching off</p>
<p>toward the water rides, the other leading to the Archangel roller</p>
<p>coaster. I’d just veered onto the latter when I saw Scott. He saw</p>
<p>me, too. We were on parallel walkways, the chair lift to the sky</p>
<p>ride separating us. A boy and girl took their seats on a chair as</p>
<p>it swung around the conveyor, momentarily breaking our eye</p>
<p>contact. I took that moment to run.</p>
<p>I shoved my way through the crowd, but the walkways were</p>
<p>congested, making it hard to move faster than stop-and-go. Worse, the walkways in this section of the park were lined with</p>
<p>high hedges, squeezing traffic through the labyrinth of twists and</p>
<p>turns. I didn’t dare look behind me, but I knew Scott couldn’t be</p>
<p>far behind. He wouldn’t try anything in front of all these people,</p>
<p>would he? I shook my head to flush out the thought, and</p>
<p>concentrated instead on where I was going. I’d been to Delphic</p>
<p>only three or four times before, always at night, and I didn’t know</p>
<p>the layout well. I could have kicked myself for not grabbing a</p>
<p>map on my way in. I found it absurdly ironic that thirty seconds</p>
<p>ago I’d been running away from the exit; now getting to it was</p>
<p>the only thing on my mind.</p>
<p>“Hey! Watch out!”</p>
<p>“Excuse me,” I said, breathless. “Which way to the exit?”</p>
<p>“Where’s the fire, man?”</p>
<p>I fought my way past the crowd. “Excuse me. I have to get</p>
<p>through … excuse me.” Above the hedges, the lights of the</p>
<p>rides blazed and glittered against the backdrop of night. I</p>
<p>rides blazed and glittered against the backdrop of night. I</p>
<p>paused at an intersection, trying to orient myself. Left or right?</p>
<p>Which would get me to the exit faster?</p>
<p>“There you are.” Scott’s breath warmed my ear. He laid his</p>
<p>hand on my neck, sending a spike of chills ricocheting to the</p>
<p>bone.</p>
<p>“Help!” I shouted on instinct. “Someone help me!”</p>
<p>“My girlfriend,” Scott explained to the few people who’d</p>
<p>paused long enough to direct their attention at us. “This is a</p>
<p>game we play.”</p>
<p>“I’m not his girlfriend!” I shouted in a panic. “Get your hands</p>
<p>off me!”</p>
<p>“Come here, sweetheart.” Scott wrestled me into his arms,</p>
<p>pinning me against him. “I warned you not to lie to me,” he</p>
<p>murmured in my ear. “I need the ring. I don’t want to hurt you,</p>
<p>Nora, but Iwill, if you make me.”</p>
<p>“Get him off me!” I shouted to anyone who would listen.</p>
<p>Scott wrenched my arm behind my back. I spoke through</p>
<p>gritted teeth, trying to battle the pain. “Are you insane?” I said. “I</p>
<p>don’t have the ring. I gave it to the police. Last night. Go get it</p>
<p>from them.”</p>
<p>“Quit lying!” he growled.</p>
<p>“Call them yourself. It’s the truth. I gave it to them. I don’t have</p>
<p>it.” I shut my eyes, praying he believed me and released my</p>
<p>arm.</p>
<p>“Then you’re going to help me get it back.”</p>
<p>“They aren’t going to give it to me. It’s evidence. I told them it</p>
<p>was your ring.”</p>
<p>“They’ll give it back,” he said slowly, as if he was forming a</p>
<p>plan as he went. “If I trade you for the ring.”</p>
<p>It all clicked into place. “You’re going to hold me hostage?</p>
<p>Trade me for the ring? Help!” I screamed. “Somebody get him</p>
<p>off me!”</p>
<p>One of the people standing nearby laughed.</p>
<p>“This isn’t a joke!” I yelled, feeling blood rise in my neck,</p>
<p>terror and desperation scraping away at me. “Get him off—”</p>
<p>Scott sealed his hand over my mouth, but I got my foot up</p>
<p>and kicked him in the shin. He gave a grunt of pain and buckled</p>
<p>in half.</p>
<p>His arms loosened slightly in the surprise of the attack, and I</p>
<p>shoved myself free. I fumbled back a step, watching agony twist</p>
<p>on his face, then turned and bolted, seeing glimpses of the</p>
<p>rides through the gaps in the crowd. All I had to do was make it</p>
<p>out. The police had to be close. Then I’d be safe. Safe. I</p>
<p>repeated the word frantically as motivation to keep my head</p>
<p>and not succumb to panic. There was a wan light left in the</p>
<p>western sky, and I used it to orient myself north. If I continued</p>
<p>north, the pathway would eventually deliver me to the gates.</p>
<p>An explosion shattered my ear. It startled me so much, I</p>
<p>tripped and went down on my knees. Or maybe I’d acted</p>
<p>reflexively, because there were others around me who’d</p>
<p>dropped to the pavement too. There was a moment of hairraising</p>
<p>quiet, and then everyone was screaming and</p>
<p>scrambling in every direction.</p>
<p>“He’s got a gun!” The words blurred together in my ears,</p>
<p>sounding so very far away.</p>
<p>Even though not one part of me wanted to, I found myself</p>
<p>turning back. Scott was clutching his side, bright red liquid</p>
<p>flowering through his shirt. His mouth was open, his eyes wide</p>
<p>with shock.</p>
<p>He went down on one knee, and I saw someone standing</p>
<p>several yards behind him, holding a gun. Rixon. Vee was at his</p>
<p>side, her hands clamped over her mouth, her face as white as a</p>
<p>sheet.</p>
<p>There was a chaotic stampede of feet and limbs and</p>
<p>panicked, chilling screams, and I scooted to the side of the</p>
<p>path, trying to avoid getting trampled on.</p>
<p>“He’s getting away!” I heard Vee shriek. “Someone get him!”</p>
<p>Rixon fired several shots, but this time nobody dropped. In</p>
<p>fact, the rush to get out intensified. I pulled myself to standing</p>
<p>and looked back to where I’d last seen Rixon and Vee. The</p>
<p>echo of the shots still pealed in my ears, but I read the words as</p>
<p>they fell from Rixon’s lips. Over here. He flagged his free arm</p>
<p>through the air. In what felt like in slow motion, I fought the</p>
<p>stream of traffic and ran to him.</p>
<p>“What the hell?!” Vee shrieked. “Why did you shoot him,</p>
<p>Rixon?”</p>
<p>“Citizen’s arrest,” he said. “Well, that, and Patch told me to.”</p>
<p>“You can’t shoot people just because Patch says to!” Vee</p>
<p>said, her eyes wild. “You’re going to get arrested. What are we</p>
<p>doing to do now?” she moaned.</p>
<p>“The police are on their way,” I said. “They know about Scott.”</p>
<p>“We have to get out of here!” said Vee, still hysterical,</p>
<p>flapping her arms and pacing a few feet, only to spin back and</p>
<p>come back to where she’d started. “I’ll take Nora to the police</p>
<p>station. Rixon, go get Scott, but don’t shoot him again—tie him</p>
<p>up like last time!”</p>
<p>“Nora can’t use the gates,” Rixon said. “That’s what he’ll</p>
<p>expect. I know another way out. Vee, get the Neon and meet us</p>
<p>at the south end of the parking lot, near the Dumpsters.”</p>
<p>“How are you going to get out?” Vee wanted to know.</p>
<p>“Through the underground tunnels.”</p>
<p>“There are tunnels under Delphic?” Vee asked.</p>
<p>Rixon kissed her forehead. “Hurry, love.”</p>
<p>The crowd had scattered, leaving the pathway empty. I could</p>
<p>still hear panicked shrieks and screams echoing down the</p>
<p>walkway, but they sounded a world away. Vee hesitated a</p>
<p>moment, then gave a resolute nod. “Just hurry, okay?”</p>
<p>“There’s a mechanical room in the basement of the fun</p>
<p>house,” Rixon explained to me as we walked in a hurry down</p>
<p>the opposite pathway. “It has a door leading into the tunnels</p>
<p>under Delphic. Scott may have heard of the tunnels, but if he</p>
<p>figures out where we’ve gone and follows us, there’s no way</p>
<p>he’ll find us. It’s like a maze down there, and it goes on for</p>
<p>miles.” He gave a nervous smile. “Don’t worry, Delphic was built</p>
<p>by fallen angels. Not me in particular, but a few of my mates</p>
<p>helped. I know the routes by heart. Er, mostly.”</p><p>

<p></p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>AS WE DREW CLOSER TO THE GRINNING CLOWN’S head leading</p>
<p>inside the fun house, the distant screams were replaced by</p>
<p>creepy music-box carnival music, tinkling loudly from the bowels</p>
<p>of the fun house. I stepped through the mouth, and the floor</p>
<p>shifted. I reached out to steady myself, but the walls turned,</p>
<p>rolling under my hands. As my eyes adjusted to the traces of</p>
<p>light filtering through the mouth of the clown behind me, I saw</p>
<p>that I was inside a revolving barrel that seemed to stretch on</p>
<p>forever. The barrel was painted with alternating stripes of red</p>
<p>and white, and they blurred together into a dizzying pink.</p>
<p>“Here,” Rixon said, guiding me through the barrel.</p>
<p>I put one foot in front of the other, sliding and blundering</p>
<p>forward. At the end, I stepped out to solid ground, only to have a</p>
<p>jet of icy air shoot up from the floor. The cold licked my skin, and</p>
<p>I jumped sideways with a startled gasp.</p>
<p>“It’s not real,” Rixon assured me. “We have to keep going. If</p>
<p>Scott decides to search the tunnels, we have to beat him inside.</p>
<p>”</p>
<p>The air was stale and humid, and smelled of rust. The</p>
<p>clown’s head was a distant memory now. The only light came</p>
<p>from red bulbs in the cavernous ceiling that blazed to life just</p>
<p>long enough to spotlight a dangling skeleton, unraveling</p>
<p>zombie, or vampire rising from a coffin.</p>
<p>“How much farther?” I asked Rixon over the distorted</p>
<p>cacophony of hoots, cackles, and wails that echoed all around.</p>
<p>“The mechanical room is just ahead. After that, we’ll be in the</p>
<p>tunnels. Scott’s bleeding pretty bad. He won’t die—Patch has</p>
<p>told you all about Nephilim, right?—but he could pass out from</p>
<p>loss of blood. Chances are, he won’t find an entrance to the</p>
<p>tunnels before he does. We’ll be back above ground before you</p>
<p>know it.” His confidence sounded slightly inflated, a little too</p>
<p>optimistic. We pushed on, and I felt the eerie sensation that we were</p>
<p>being followed. I spun back, but the darkness was consuming. If</p>
<p>someone was back there, I couldn’t see.</p>
<p>“Do you think Scott could have followed us?” I asked Rixon,</p>
<p>keeping my voice low.</p>
<p>Rixon stopped, turned back. Listened. After a moment, he</p>
<p>said with certainty, “There’s no one there.” We were continuing our hurried pace toward the mechanical</p>
<p>room, when I once again felt a presence behind me. My scalp</p>
<p>tingled, and I cut a look over my shoulder. This time, the outline</p>
<p>of a face materialized through the darkness. I almost cried out,</p>
<p>and then the outline solidified into a distinct and familiar face.</p>
<p>My dad.</p>
<p>His blond hair was bright against the darkness, his eyes</p>
<p>shining, yet sad. I love you.</p>
<p>“Dad?” I whispered. But I took a cautionary step back. I</p>
<p>reminded myself of the last times. He was a trick.A lie.</p>
<p>I’m sorry I had to leave you and your mom.</p>
<p>Iwilled him to disappear. He wasn’t real. He was a threat. He</p>
<p>wanted to hurt me. I remembered the way he’d yanked my arm</p>
<p>through the townhouse window and tried to cut me. I</p>
<p>remembered how he’d chased me through the library.</p>
<p>But his voice was the same gentle coaxing he’d used that</p>
<p>very first time at the townhouse. Not the stern, sharp voice that</p>
<p>had replaced it. It was his voice.</p>
<p>I love you, Nora. Whatever happens, promise me you’ll</p>
<p>remember that. I don’t care howor why you came into my life,</p>
<p>only that you did. I don’t remember all the things I did wrong. I</p>
<p>remember what I did right. I remember you. You made my life</p>
<p>meaningful. You made my life special.</p>
<p>I shook my head, trying to sweep out his voice, wondering</p>
<p>why Rixon wasn’t saying anything—couldn’t he see my dad?</p>
<p>Wasn’t there anything we could do to make him go away? But</p>
<p>the truth of the matter was, I didn’t want his voice to stop. I didn’t</p>
<p>want him to leave. Iwanted him to be real. I needed him to wrap</p>
<p>his arms around me and tell me everything was going to be all</p>
<p>right. Most of all, I longed for him to come home.</p>
<p>Promise you’ll remember.</p>
<p>Tears dripped down my cheeks. I promise, I thought back,</p>
<p>even though I knew he couldn’t hear me.</p>
<p>An angel of death helped me come here to see you. She’s</p>
<p>holding time still for us, Nora. She’s helping me speak to your</p>
<p>mind. There’s something important I need to tell you, but I</p>
<p>don’t have much time. I have to go back soon, and I need you</p>
<p>to listen carefully.</p>
<p>“No,” I choked, my voice coming out strangled. “I’m going</p>
<p>with you. Don’t leave me here. I’m going with you! You can’t</p>
<p>leave me again!”</p>
<p>I can’t stay, baby. I belong somewhere else now.</p>
<p>“Please don’t go,” I sobbed, clutching my fists against my</p>
<p>chest as if I could stop my heart from swelling. A certain</p>
<p>desperate panic seized me when I thought of him leaving again.</p>
<p>My sheer sense of abandonment outweighed everything else.</p>
<p>He was going to leave me here. In the fun house. In the dark,</p>
<p>with no one to help me but Rixon. “Why are you leaving me all</p>
<p>over again? I need you!”</p>
<p>Touch Rixon’s scars. The truth is there.</p>
<p>My dad’s face receded into the darkness. I reached out to</p>
<p>stop him, but his face turned into a ribbon of fog at my touch.</p>
<p>The silvery white threads dissolved into the darkness.</p>
<p>“Nora?”</p>
<p>I started at the sound of Rixon’s voice. “We have to hurry,” he</p>
<p>said, as if no more than a ripple of time had passed. “We don’t</p>
<p>want to meet up with Scott in the outer ring of the tunnels, where</p>
<p>all the entrances feed.”</p>
<p>My dad was gone. For reasons I couldn’t explain, I knew I’d</p>
<p>seen him for the last time. The pain and loss was unbearable.</p>
<p>At the moment when I needed him most, when I was heading</p>
<p>into the tunnels, scared and lost, he’d left me to face this alone.</p>
<p>“I can’t see where I’m going,” I gasped, swatting my eyes dry,</p>
<p>struggling through the frustrating process of trying to focus my</p>
<p>thoughts on one specific goal: getting to the tunnels and</p>
<p>meeting Vee on the other side. “I need something to hold.”</p>
<p>Rixon impatiently thrust the hem of his shirt out to me. “Hold</p>
<p>the back of my shirt and follow me. Keep up. We haven’t got a</p>
<p>lot of time.”</p>
<p>I squeezed the worn cotton between my fingers, my heart</p>
<p>beating stronger. Inches away was the bare skin of his back. My</p>
<p>dad had told me to touch his scars; it would be so easy now. All</p>
<p>I had to do was slide my hand …</p>
<p>Succumb to the dark suction that would swallow me whole …</p>
<p>I thought back to the times I’d touched Patch’s scars, and</p>
<p>how I’d been briefly transported inside his memory. Without a</p>
<p>shred of doubt, I knew touching Rixon’s scars would do the</p>
<p>same thing.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to go. I wanted to keep my feet under me, get to</p>
<p>the tunnels, and get out of Delphic.</p>
<p>But my dad had come back to tell me where to find the truth. Whatever I’d see in Rixon’s past, it had to be important. As</p>
<p>much as it hurt to know my dad had left me here, I had to trust</p>
<p>him. I had to trust he’d risked everything to tell me.</p>
<p>I slid my hand up the back of Rixon’s shirt. I felt smooth skin … then a bumpy ridge of scar tissue. I splayed my hand against</p>
<p>the scar, waiting to be ripped into a strange, foreign world.</p>
<p>The street was quiet, dark. The houses framing both sides of it</p>
<p>were derelict, ramshackle. Yards were small and fenced.</p>
<p>Windows were boarded or barred. A heavy frost sank its teeth</p>
<p>into my skin.</p>
<p>Two loud explosions ruptured the silence. I swung to face the</p>
<p>house across the street. Gunshots? I thought in a panic. I</p>
<p>immediately searched through my pockets for my cell phone,</p>
<p>meaning to call 911, when I remembered I was trapped in</p>
<p>Rixon’s memory. Everything I was seeing had happened in the</p>
<p>past. I couldn’t change anything now.</p>
<p>The sound of running footsteps rang through the night, and I</p>
<p>watched in shock as my dad let himself through the gate of the</p>
<p>house across the street and disappeared around the side yard. Without waiting, I took off after him.</p>
<p>“Dad!” I screamed, unable to help myself. “Don’t go back</p>
<p>there!” He was wearing the same clothes he’d gone out in the</p>
<p>night he’d been killed. I pushed through the gate and met him at</p>
<p>the back corner of the house. Sobbing, I threw my arms around</p>
<p>him. “We have to go back. We have to get out of here.</p>
<p>Something horrible is going to happen.”</p>
<p>My dad walked right through my arms, crossing to a small</p>
<p>stone wall that ran alongside the property. He inched down the</p>
<p>wall in a crouch, eyes trained on the back door of the house. I</p>
<p>leaned into the siding, bowed my head against my arms, and</p>
<p>cried. I didn’t want to see this. Why had my dad told me to touch</p>
<p>Rixon’s scars? I didn’t want this. Didn’t he know how much pain</p>
<p>I’d already suffered?</p>
<p>“Last chance.” The words were spoken from inside the</p>
<p>house, drifting out through the open back door.</p>
<p>“Go to hell.”</p>
<p>Another explosion, and I slumped to my knees, pressing</p>
<p>myself against the siding, willing the memory to end.</p>
<p>“Where is she?” The question was asked so quietly, so</p>
<p>calmly, I almost couldn’t hear it over my soft crying.</p>
<p>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw my dad move. He crept</p>
<p>across the yard, moving toward the door. A gun was in his hand,</p>
<p>and he raised it, taking aim. I ran at him, grabbing at his hands,</p>
<p>trying to wrestle the gun away from him, trying to push him back</p>
<p>into the shadows. But it was like moving a ghost—my hands</p>
<p>passed right through him.</p>
<p>My dad pulled the trigger. The shot cut open the night, ripping</p>
<p>the silence in half. Again and again he fired. Even though no</p>
<p>part of me wanted to, I faced the house, seeing the lean build of</p>
<p>the young man my dad was shooting from behind. Just beyond</p>
<p>him, another man sat slumped on the floor, his back propped up</p>
<p>by the sofa. He was bleeding, and his expression was twisted</p>
<p>in agony and fear.</p>
<p>In a moment muddled with confusion, I realized it was Hank</p>
<p>Millar.</p>
<p>“Run!” Hank shouted at my dad. “Leave me behind! Run and</p>
<p>save yourself!”</p>
<p>My dad didn’t run. He held the gun level, shooting over and</p>
<p>over, sending bullets flying at the open door, where the young</p>
<p>man in a blue ball cap seemed impervious to them. And then,</p>
<p>very slowly, he turned to face my dad.</p><p>

<p></p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>RIXON GRABBED MYWRIST,GIVINGITAFIRM squeeze. “Careful whose</p>
<p>business you go sticking your nose in.” His jaw was set in</p>
<p>anger, his nostrils flaring slightly. “Maybe that’s the way it is with</p>
<p>Patch, but nobody touches my scars.” He arched his eyebrows</p>
<p>meaningfully.</p>
<p>My stomach was cinched with a knot so tight I almost</p>
<p>doubled over. “I saw my dad die,” I blurted, stricken with horror.</p>
<p>“Did you see the killer?” Rixon asked, shaking my wrist to</p>
<p>pull me all the way back to the present.</p>
<p>“I saw Patch from behind,” I gasped. “He was wearing his</p>
<p>ball cap.”</p>
<p>He nodded, as if accepting that what I’d seen couldn’t be</p>
<p>undone. “He didn’t want to keep the truth from you, but he knew</p>
<p>that if he told you, he’d lose you. It happened before he knew</p>
<p>you.”</p>
<p>“I don’t care when it happened,” I said, my voice shrill and</p>
<p>shaking. “He needs to be brought to justice.”</p>
<p>“You can’t bring him to justice. He’s Patch. If you report him,</p>
<p>do you really think he’s going to let the cops haul him off?”</p>
<p>No, I didn’t. The police meant nothing to Patch. Only the</p>
<p>archangels could stop him. “There’s just one thing I don’t</p>
<p>understand. There were only three people in the memory. My</p>
<p>dad, Patch, and Hank Millar. The three of them saw what</p>
<p>happened. Then how am I seeing this in your memory?”</p>
<p>Rixon didn’t say anything, but the lines around his mouth</p>
<p>tightened.</p>
<p>A horrible new thought settled over me. All certainty in regard</p>
<p>to my dad’s killer evaporated. I’d seen the killer from the back</p>
<p>and assumed it was Patch because of the ball cap. But the</p>
<p>longer I dwelled on the memory, the more I was sure the killer</p>
<p>was too lanky to be Patch, the cut of his shoulders too angular.</p>
<p>In fact, the killer looked a lot like …</p>
<p>“You killed him,” I whispered. “It was you. You were wearing</p>
<p>Patch’s hat.” The shock of the moment was quickly being eaten</p>
<p>up by abhorrence and ice-cold fear. “You killed my dad.”</p>
<p>Any trace of kindness or sympathy vanished from Rixon’s</p>
<p>eyes. “Well, this is awkward.”</p>
<p>“You were wearing Patch’s hat that night. You borrowed it,</p>
<p>didn’t you? You couldn’t kill my dad without assuming another</p>
<p>identity. You couldn’t do it unless you removed yourself from the</p>
<p>situation,” I said, drawing on everything I remembered from the</p>
<p>psychology unit in my freshman health class. “No. Wait. That’s</p>
<p>not it. You pretended to be Patch because you wish you were</p>
<p>him. You’re jealous of him. That’s it, isn’t it? You’d rather be</p>
<p>him—”</p>
<p>Rixon gripped my cheekbones, forcing me to stop. “Shut up.</p>
<p>”</p>
<p>I recoiled, my jaw aching where he’d squeezed me. I wanted</p>
<p>to fling myself at him, hitting him with everything I had, but knew I</p>
<p>needed to stay calm. I needed to find out what I could. I was</p>
<p>beginning to think Rixon hadn’t brought me into the tunnels to</p>
<p>help me escape. Worse, I was beginning to think he had no</p>
<p>intention of ever taking me back up.</p>
<p>“Jealous of him?” he said cruelly. “Sure I’m jealous. He isn’t</p>
<p>the one on the fast track to hell. We were in this together, and</p>
<p>now he’s gone and gotten himself his wings back.” His eyes</p>
<p>raked over me in disgust. “Because of you.”</p>
<p>I shook my head, not buying it. “You killed my dad before you</p>
<p>even knew who Iwas.”</p>
<p>He laughed, but it lacked humor. “I knew you were out there</p>
<p>somewhere, and Iwas looking for you.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>Rixon slipped the gun out from under his shirt and used it to</p>
<p>motion deeper into the fun house. “Keep walking.”</p>
<p>“Where are we going?”</p>
<p>He didn’t answer.</p>
<p>“The police are on their way.”</p>
<p>“Hang the police,” Rixon said. “I’ll be finished before they get</p>
<p>here.”</p>
<p>Finished?</p>
<p>Stay calm, I told myself. Stall. “You’re going to kill me now</p>
<p>that I know the truth? Now that I know you killed my dad?”</p>
<p>“HarrisonGrey wasn’t your dad.”</p>
<p>I opened my mouth, but the argument I expected to come</p>
<p>flying out didn’t. The one image splayed across the forefront of</p>
<p>my mind was of Marcie standing in her front yard, telling me</p>
<p>Hank Millar could be my father. I felt my stomach heave. Did this</p>
<p>mean Marcie was telling the truth? For sixteen years I’d been</p>
<p>kept in the dark about the truth behind my family? I wondered if</p>
<p>my dad had known—my real dad. Harrison Grey. The man</p>
<p>who’d raised and loved me. Not my biological father, who’d</p>
<p>abandoned me. Not Hank Millar, who could go to hell for all I</p>
<p>cared.</p>
<p>“Your dad is a Nephil named Barnabas,” Rixon said. “More</p>
<p>recently, he goes by Hank Millar.”</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I stepped sideways, dizzy with the truth. The dream. Patch’s</p>
<p>dream. It was a real memory. He hadn’t been lying. Barnabas—</p>
<p>Hank Millar—was Nephilim.</p>
<p>And he was my father.</p>
<p>My world threatened to crash down around me, but I forced</p>
<p>myself to stay in the moment a little longer. In the far back of my</p>
<p>mind, I shook my memory, frantically trying to remember where</p>
<p>I’d heard the name Barnabas before. I couldn’t place it, but I</p>
<p>knew this wasn’t the first time I’d heard it. It was too unusual to</p>
<p>forget. Barnabas, Barnabas, Barnabas …</p>
<p>I grappled to fit two loose ends together. Why was Rixon</p>
<p>telling me this? Why did he know about my biological father?</p>
<p>Why did he care? And then it hit me. Once, when I’d touched</p>
<p>Patch’s scars and gone into his memory, I’d heard him talk</p>
<p>about his Nephil vassal, Chauncey Langeais. He’d also talked</p>
<p>about Rixon’s vassal, Barnabas….</p>
<p>“No,” Iwhispered, the word slipping out.</p>
<p>“Aye.”</p>
<p>I desperately wanted to run, but my legs were wooden, stiff</p>
<p>as posts.</p>
<p>“When Hank got your mum pregnant, he’d heard enough</p>
<p>rumors about the Book of Enoch to worry that I’d come looking</p>
<p>for the baby, especially if it was a girl. So he did the only thing</p>
<p>he could. He hid her. You. When Hank told his mate Harrison</p>
<p>Grey that your mum was in trouble, he agreed to marry her and</p>
<p>pretend you were his.”</p>
<p>No, no, no. “But I’m descended from Chauncey. On my</p>
<p>father’s side. On Harrison Grey’s side. I have a mark on my</p>
<p>wrist that proves it.”</p>
<p>“Aye, you do. Many centuries ago, Chauncey entertained a</p>
<p>naive farm girl. She had a son. Nobody thought anything</p>
<p>particular about the boy, or his sons, or their sons, and so on</p>
<p>through the ages, until one of the sons slept with a woman</p>
<p>outside of wedlock. He injected the noble Nephilim blood of his</p>
<p>ancestor, the duke of Langeais, into another line. The line that</p>
<p>eventually produced Barnabas, or Hank, as he seems to prefer</p>
<p>recently.” Rixon gestured impatiently for me to put two and two</p>
<p>together. I already had.</p>
<p>“You’re saying both Harrison and Hank have Chauncey’s</p>
<p>Nephilim blood,” I said. And Hank, a purebred first-generation</p>
<p>Nephil, was immortal, while my own dad’s Nephilim blood,</p>
<p>diluted over centuries just like mine, was not. Hank, a man I</p>
<p>hardly knew and respected even less, could live forever.</p>
<p>While my dad was gone forever.</p>
<p>“I am, love.”</p>
<p>“Don’t call me love.”</p>
<p>“You’d prefer Angel?”</p>
<p>He was making fun of me. Toying with me, because he had</p>
<p>me right where he wanted. I’d been through this once before,</p>
<p>with Patch, and I knew what was coming. Hank Millar was my</p>
<p>biological father and Rixon’s Nephil vassal. Rixon was going to</p>
<p>sacrifice me to kill Hank Millar and get a human body.</p>
<p>“Do I get any last-minute answers?” I asked, my tone edging</p>
<p>toward challenging, in spite of my fear.</p>
<p>He shrugged. “Why not?”</p>
<p>“I thought only first-generation purebred Nephilim could</p>
<p>swear fealty. In order for Hank to be first-generation, he’d have</p>
<p>to have a human and a fallen angel parent. But his father wasn’t</p>
<p>a fallen angel. He was one of Chauncey’s male descendants.”</p>
<p>“You’re overlooking the fact that men can have affairs with</p>
<p>female fallen angels.”</p>
<p>I shook my head. “Fallen angels don’t have human bodies.</p>
<p>Females can’t give birth. Patch told me.”</p>
<p>“But a female fallen angel, possessing a female human body</p>
<p>during Cheshvan, can produce a baby. The human may give</p>
<p>birth to the baby long after Cheshvan, but the baby is tainted. It</p>
<p>was conceived by a fallen angel.”</p>
<p>“That’s revolting.”</p>
<p>He smiled faintly. “I agree.”</p>
<p>“Out of morbid curiosity, when you sacrifice me, does your</p>
<p>body just become human, or do you possess another human</p>
<p>body just become human, or do you possess another human</p>
<p>body for good?”</p>
<p>“I become human.” His mouth curved slightly. “So if you come</p>
<p>back to haunt me from the grave, just know you’ll be looking for</p>
<p>my same handsome mug.”</p>
<p>“Patch could show up any minute now and stop you,” I said,</p>
<p>trying to be strong, but unable to stop the unbearable shaking in</p>
<p>every limb of my body.</p>
<p>His eyes laughed at me. “I had my work cut out, but I’m</p>
<p>confident I drove the wedge between the two of you about as</p>
<p>deep as it could go. You got the ball rolling by breaking up with</p>
<p>him—I couldn’t have planned it better myself. Then there was</p>
<p>the constant fighting, your jealousy over Marcie, and Patch’s</p>
<p>card—which I drugged to toss in just one more seed of distrust. When I stole the ring from Barnabas and had it delivered to you</p>
<p>at the bakery, I had no doubt Patch was the last person you’d</p>
<p>run to. Swallow your pride and ask for his help? When you</p>
<p>thought he was hooked up with Marcie? Not a chance. You</p>
<p>played right into my hands when you asked me if he was the</p>
<p>Black Hand. I made the evidence against him overwhelming</p>
<p>when I answered that yes, he was. Then I took advantage of the</p>
<p>turn in our conversation to mention the address of one of</p>
<p>Barnabas’s Nephilim safe houses as Patch’s, knowing full well</p>
<p>you’d go snooping around and probably find memorabilia from</p>
<p>the Black Hand. I canceled the movie plans last night, not</p>
<p>Patch. I didn’t want to be stuck inside a movie theater while you</p>
<p>were all alone in the apartment. I needed to follow you. I planted</p>
<p>the dynamite once you were inside, hoping to sacrifice you, but</p>
<p>you got away.”</p>
<p>“I’m touched, Rixon. A bomb. How elaborate. Why didn’t you</p>
<p>keep things simple and just march inside my bedroom one</p>
<p>night and put a bullet between my eyes?”</p>
<p>He spread his hands in front of him. “This is a big moment for</p>
<p>me, Nora. Can you blame me for wanting a little flourish? I tried</p>
<p>posing as Harrison’s ghost to lure you close, thinking how</p>
<p>fantastic it would be to send you to the grave thinking your own</p>
<p>father had killed you, but you didn’t trust me. You kept running</p>
<p>away.” He frowned a little.</p>
<p>“You’re a psychopath.”</p>
<p>“I prefer creative.”</p>
<p>“What else was a lie? At the beach, did you tell me Patch</p>
<p>was still my guardian angel—”</p>
<p>“To lull you into a false sense of security? Yes.”</p>
<p>“And the blood oath?”</p>
<p>“A spur-of-the-moment lie. Just to keep things interesting.”</p>
<p>“So basically you’re telling me nothing you’ve ever said to me</p>
<p>was true.”</p>
<p>“Except the part about sacrificing you. I was dead serious</p>
<p>about that. Enough talking. Let’s get on with this.” Using the gun,</p>
<p>he shoved me deeper into the fun house. The rough prod tipped</p>
<p>me off balance, and I stepped sideways to catch my footing,</p>
<p>landing on a section of floor that began undulating up and down.</p>
<p>I felt Rixon grab for my wrist to steady me, only something went</p>
<p>wrong. His hand slipped down over mine. I heard the soft thud</p>
<p>of his body landing. The sound seemed to come from directly</p>
<p>below.A thought brushed my mind—that he’d fallen down one of</p>
<p>below.A thought brushed my mind—that he’d fallen down one of</p>
<p>the many trapdoors rumored to be scattered throughout the fun</p>
<p>house—but I didn’t stay around long enough to see if I’d</p>
<p>guessed right.</p>
<p>I bolted back the way we’d come, searching for the clown</p>
<p>head. A figure sprang out in front of me, a light flashing</p>
<p>overhead to illuminate a blood-soaked ax wedged in a bearded</p>
<p>pirate’s head. He leered at me a moment before his eyes rolled</p>
<p>back in his head and the light faded.</p>
<p>I drew several sharp breaths, telling myself it was pretend,</p>
<p>but unable to steady myself as the floor quaked and shifted</p>
<p>under my shoes. I went down on my knees, crawling over the</p>
<p>grime and grit pressing into my palms, trying to calm my head,</p>
<p>which seemed to tilt with the floors. I crawled for several feet,</p>
<p>not wanting to stop moving long enough to let Rixon find a way</p>
<p>out of the trapdoor.</p>
<p>“Nora!” Rixon’s rough bark carried up behind me.</p>
<p>I pulled myself up, using the walls to support me, but the walls</p>
<p>were coated in slime that oozed onto my hands. Somewhere</p>
<p>overhead, laughter boomed, tapering off to a cackle. I shook my</p>
<p>hands hard to slough off the slime. Then I fished my way into the</p>
<p>sheer blackness that lay ahead. Iwas lost. Lost, lost, lost.</p>
<p>I jogged a few steps forward, rounded a turn, and squinted at</p>
<p>the faint glow of orange light several yards down the path. It</p>
<p>wasn’t the clown’s head, but I was drawn to the promise of light</p>
<p>like a moth. When I reached the lantern, the tacky Halloweenish</p>
<p>light illuminated the words TUNNEL of doom. I was standing on</p>
<p>a boat dock. Small plastic boats were parked nose-to-bumper,</p>
<p>water from the canal lapping their sides.</p>
<p>I heard footsteps on the path behind me. With no time to</p>
<p>second-guess, I stepped into the boat closest to me. I’d just</p>
<p>found my balance when the boat lurched into motion, jerking me</p>
<p>down onto the slat of wood that served as a seat. The boats</p>
<p>were moving in a single-file line, the tracks below clacking as</p>
<p>they steered the boats into the tunnel ahead. A pair of saloonstyle</p>
<p>doors flung open, swallowing my boat into the tunnel.</p>
<p>Feeling my way to the front of the boat, I climbed over the</p>
<p>safety bar and onto the bow. I stayed there a moment, one hand</p>
<p>anchoring me to the boat, while my other hand reached ahead,</p>
<p>trying to grab the rear bar of the boat one up. Iwas a few inches</p>
<p>short. I would have to jump. I scooted up the bow as far as I</p>
<p>dared. I tucked my legs under me, then leaped, managing to</p>
<p>skid onto the back of the next boat up.</p>
<p>I allowed myself one moment of relief, then went back to</p>
<p>work. Once again, I moved up the bow, with the intention of</p>
<p>jumping boats all the way to the end of the ride. Rixon was</p>
<p>bigger and faster, and he had a gun. My only hope of survival</p>
<p>was to keep moving, to keep drawing out the time it took for</p>
<p>him to catch me.</p>
<p>I was on the next bow, preparing to jump, when a siren</p>
<p>blasted and the sudden illumination of a red light overhead</p>
<p>blinded me. A skeleton dropped from the ceiling of the tunnel,</p>
<p>smacking into me. I lost my footing and felt a wash of vertigo as</p>
<p>I skidded sideways, overboard. Frigid water rushed through my</p>
<p>clothes, closing over my head. Instantly I put my feet down,</p>
<p>broke the water’s surface, and waded through the chest-deep</p>
<p>broke the water’s surface, and waded through the chest-deep</p>
<p>water back to the boat. Gritting my teeth against the cold, I</p>
<p>clamped my hands around the boat’s safety bar and hauled</p>
<p>myself back inside.</p>
<p>Several loud shots ricocheted through the tunnel, one of the</p>
<p>bullets whizzing past my ear. I dropped low in the boat, while</p>
<p>Rixon’s laugh carried from a few boats back. “A matter of time,”</p>
<p>he called.</p>
<p>More lights were flashing overhead, and between the pulses</p>
<p>of light, I could see Rixon making his way across the boats</p>
<p>toward me.</p>
<p>A faint roar sounded somewhere ahead. My stomach slid out</p>
<p>from beneath me. I felt my concentration peel away from Rixon</p>
<p>and shift to the spray of moisture in the air. My heart stopped for</p>
<p>a half moment, then started pounding much too hard.</p>
<p>Grabbing hold of the metal bar, I braced myself for the fall.</p>
<p>The front of the boat tipped, then plunged over the waterfall. The</p>
<p>boat splashed at the bottom, sending water spraying over the</p>
<p>sides. The water might have felt cold, had I not already been</p>
<p>drenched and shivering. I wiped my eyes dry, and that was</p>
<p>when I saw a small maintenance platform carved out of the</p>
<p>tunnel wall to my right. A door marked DANGER: HIGH VOLTAGE sat</p>
<p>just back from the platform.</p>
<p>I looked back at the waterfall. Rixon’s boat hadn’t fallen yet,</p>
<p>and with only seconds to spare, I made a risky decision.</p>
<p>Jumping over the side of the boat, I waded as quickly as I could</p>
<p>to the platform, hoisted myself up, and tried the door. It opened,</p>
<p>letting out the loud hissing and clanking of machines, hundreds</p>
<p>of gears churning and grinding. I’d found the mechanical heart</p>
<p>of the fun house, and the entrance to the underground tunnels.</p>
<p>I closed the door most of the way behind me, leaving a thin</p>
<p>crack to see out. With one eye pressed to the crack, Iwatched the next boat fly</p>
<p>down the waterfall. Rixon was in the boat. He was leaning over</p>
<p>the metal sidebar, searching the water. Had he seen me jump</p>
<p>out? Was he looking for me? His boat continued down the</p>
<p>track, and he eased himself overboard, landing feetfirst in the</p>
<p>water. Using his hands to hold his wet hair out of his face, he</p>
<p>searched the murky surface of the water. It was then that I</p>
<p>realized his hands were empty. He wasn’t looking for me—he’d</p>
<p>dropped the gun in the fall, and he was looking for it.</p>
<p>The tunnel was dark, and I found it impossible to believe</p>
<p>Rixon could see all the way to the bottom of the canal. Which</p>
<p>meant he was going to have to feel his way to the gun. That</p>
<p>would take time. Of course, I needed more than time. I needed</p>
<p>a stroke of impossible luck. The police had to be combing the</p>
<p>park by now, but would they think to look in the underbelly of the</p>
<p>fun house before it was too late?</p>
<p>I shut the door softly, hoping to find a lock on the inside, but</p>
<p>there was none. Suddenly I wished I’d risked my chances</p>
<p>making it out of the tunnel before Rixon, rather than circling</p>
<p>back to hide. If Rixon came inside the service room, I was</p>
<p>trapped.</p>
<p>Ragged breathing came from my left, behind an electrical</p>
<p>box.</p>
<p>I swung around, eyes darting through the blackness. “Who’s</p>
<p>I swung around, eyes darting through the blackness. “Who’s</p>
<p>there?”</p>
<p>“Who do you think?”</p>
<p>I blinked against the shadows. “Scott?” I took several</p>
<p>nervous steps backward.</p>
<p>“I got lost in the tunnels. I took a door, and came out in here.”</p>
<p>“Are you still bleeding?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Surprisingly, I’m not completely drained yet.” His</p>
<p>words were choppy, and I could tell it took a lot of energy for him</p>
<p>to speak.</p>
<p>“You need a doctor.”</p>
<p>He gave a spent laugh. “I need the ring.”</p>
<p>At this point, I didn’t know how serious Scott was about</p>
<p>getting the ring back. He was exhausted with pain, and I was</p>
<p>pretty sure we both knew he wasn’t going to drag me out of</p>
<p>here to hold as a hostage. He was weakened by the shot, but</p>
<p>he was Nephilim. He would survive this. Working together, we</p>
<p>had a chance at getting out. But before I could convince him to</p>
<p>help me escape Rixon, I needed him to trust me.</p>
<p>I walked over to the electrical box and knelt down beside</p>
<p>him. He had one hand pressed against his side, just below his</p>
<p>rib cage, stopping the flow of blood. His face was the color of</p>
<p>cornstarch, and the wasted look in his eyes proved what I</p>
<p>already knew: He was in a lot of pain. “I don’t believe you’re</p>
<p>going to use the ring to recruit new members,” I said quietly.</p>
<p>“You aren’t going to force other people into the society.”</p>
<p>Scott shook his head, agreeing with me. “There’s something</p>
<p>I need to tell you. Remember when I told you I was working the</p>
<p>night your dad was shot?”</p>
<p>I vaguely remembered him telling me he’d been at work</p>
<p>when he got the call about my dad’s murder. “Where’s this</p>
<p>going?” I asked hesitantly.</p>
<p>“I worked at a convenience store called Quickies that was</p>
<p>only a few blocks away.” He paused, as if waiting for me to</p>
<p>come to some grand conclusion. “Iwas supposed to follow your</p>
<p>dad that night. The Black Hand told me to. He said your dad</p>
<p>was on his way to a meeting, and I had to keep him safe.”</p>
<p>“What are you saying?” I asked in a voice as dry as chalk.</p>
<p>“I didn’t follow him.” Scott bowed his face into his hands. “I</p>
<p>wanted to show the Black Hand he couldn’t order me around. I</p>
<p>wanted to show him Iwouldn’t be part of his society. So I stayed</p>
<p>at work. I didn’t leave. I didn’t follow your dad. And he died. He</p>
<p>died because of me.”</p>
<p>I slid my back down the wall until I was seated beside him. I</p>
<p>couldn’t speak. The right words weren’t there.</p>
<p>“You hate me, don’t you?” he asked.</p>
<p>“You didn’t kill my dad,” I said numbly. “It’s not your fault.”</p>
<p>“I knew he was in trouble. Why else would the Black Hand</p>
<p>want to make sure he made it to the meeting safe? I should</p>
<p>have gone. If I’d followed the Black Hand’s orders, your dad</p>
<p>would be alive.”</p>
<p>“It’s in the past,” I whispered, trying not to let this information</p>
<p>cause me to blame Scott. I needed his help. Together, we could</p>
<p>get out of here. I couldn’t allow myself to hate him. I had to work</p>
<p>with him. I needed to trust him, and I needed him to trust me.</p>
<p>“Just because it’s in the past doesn’t mean it’s easy to</p>
<p>“Just because it’s in the past doesn’t mean it’s easy to</p>
<p>forget. Less than an hour after I was supposed to follow your</p>
<p>dad, my dad called with the news.” Without meaning to, Imade a small whimpering noise.</p>
<p>“Then the Black Hand came into the convenience store. He</p>
<p>was wearing a mask, but I recognized his voice.” Scott</p>
<p>shuddered. “I’ll never forget that voice. He gave me a gun and</p>
<p>told me to make sure it never surfaced again. It was your dad’s</p>
<p>gun. He said he wanted the police report to say your dad died</p>
<p>an innocent and unarmed man. He didn’t want to put your family</p>
<p>through the pain and confusion of knowing what really</p>
<p>happened that night. He didn’t want anyone to suspect your dad</p>
<p>was involved with criminals like himself. He wanted it to look</p>
<p>like a random mugging.</p>
<p>“I was supposed to toss the gun in the river, but I kept it. I</p>
<p>wanted out of the society. The only way I saw that happening</p>
<p>was if I had something I could use to blackmail the Black Hand.</p>
<p>So I kept the gun. When my mom and I moved here, I left a</p>
<p>message behind for the Black Hand. I told him if he came</p>
<p>looking for me, I’d make sure the police got their hands on</p>
<p>Harrison Grey’s gun. I’d make sure the whole world knew he</p>
<p>had ties to the Black Hand. I swore I’d drag your dad’s name</p>
<p>through the mud as many times as it took, if it meant I got my life</p>
<p>back. I still have the gun.” He opened his hands, and it dropped</p>
<p>between his knees, clattering on the cement. “I still have it.”</p>
<p>A dull and furious pain ricocheted through me.</p>
<p>“It was so hard to be around you,” Scott said, his voice brittle.</p>
<p>“I wanted to make you hate me. God knows I hated myself.</p>
<p>Every time I saw you, all I could think about was that I chickened</p>
<p>out. I could have saved your dad’s life. I’m sorry,” he said, his</p>
<p>voice cracking.</p>
<p>“It’s okay.” I said it as much for myself as Scott. “Everything’s</p>
<p>going to be okay.” But it felt like the worst lie yet.</p>
<p>Scott picked up the gun, fingering it. Before the whole</p>
<p>moment made sense to me, I saw him raise it to his head. “I</p>
<p>don’t deserve to live,” he said.</p>
<p>A veil of ice choked my heart. “Scott—,” I began.</p>
<p>“Your family deserves this. I can’t face you anymore. I can’t</p>
<p>face myself.” His finger slid to the trigger.</p>
<p>There was no time to think. “You didn’t kill my dad,” I said.</p>
<p>“Rixon did—Vee’s boyfriend. He’s a fallen angel. It’s real, all of</p>
<p>it. You’re Nephilim, Scott. You can’t kill yourself. Not this way.</p>
<p>You’re immortal. You’re never going to die. If you want to make</p>
<p>amends for any guilt you feel over my dad’s death, help me get</p>
<p>out of here. Rixon is on the other side of that door, and he’s</p>
<p>going to kill me. The only way I’m going to survive is if you help</p>
<p>me.”</p>
<p>Scott stared back wordlessly. Before he could answer, the</p>
<p>service room door scraped open. Rixon appeared in the</p>
<p>opening. He raked his hair off his forehead and cast his eyes</p>
<p>around the small utility room. On an impulse of self-protection, I</p>
<p>drew closer to Scott.</p>
<p>Rixon’s gaze shifted from me to Scott.</p>
<p>“You’re going to have to go through me before you get to her,”</p>
<p>Scott said, laying his left arm across me and shifting his weight</p>
<p>to shield my body. He was breathing rapidly.</p>
<p>to shield my body. He was breathing rapidly.</p>
<p>“No problem.” Rixon raised his gun and fired several rounds</p>
<p>into Scott. Scott slumped, his body lax against mine.</p>
<p>Tears streamed down my face. “Stop,” Iwhispered.</p>
<p>“Don’t cry, love. He’s not dead. Make no mistake—he’ll be in</p>
<p>tremendous pain when he comes around, but that’s the price</p>
<p>you pay for a body. Get up and come here.”</p>
<p>“Screw you.” I didn’t know where my courage was coming</p>
<p>from, but if I was going to die, it wouldn’t be without a fight. “You</p>
<p>killed my dad. I’m not doing anything for you. If you want me,</p>
<p>come and get me yourself.”</p>
<p>Rixon brushed his thumb across his mouth. “I don’t see why</p>
<p>you’re so worked up about it. Technically, Harrison wasn’t your</p>
<p>dad.”</p>
<p>“You killed my dad,” I repeated, meeting Rixon’s eyes, feeling</p>
<p>anger so sharp and slicing, it seemed to eat its way out of me.</p>
<p>“Harrison Grey killed himself. He should have stayed out of</p>
<p>the picture.”</p>
<p>“He was trying to save another man’s life!”</p>
<p>“A man?” Rixon snorted, rolling his wet sleeves up to his</p>
<p>elbows. “I’d hardly call Hank Millar a man. He’s Nephilim. An</p>
<p>animal, more like it.”</p>
<p>I laughed, actually laughed, but it seemed to swell like a</p>
<p>bubble in my throat, choking me. “You know what? I almost feel</p>
<p>sorry for you.”</p>
<p>“Funny, Iwas just about to say the same thing to you.”</p>
<p>“You’re going to kill me now, aren’t you?” I expected the</p>
<p>realization to draw another measure of fear from deep inside</p>
<p>me, but all my fear was spent. I felt a certain frozen calm. Time</p>
<p>didn’t slow down, and it didn’t speed up. It looked me right in</p>
<p>the eye, as cold and unemotional as the gun Rixon was now</p>
<p>pointing at me.</p>
<p>“No, not kill. I’m going to sacrifice you.” His mouth curled up</p>
<p>on one side. “Makes a world of difference.”</p>
<p>I tried to run, but the searing fire exploded, and my body was</p>
<p>thrown back against the wall. The pain was everywhere, and I</p>
<p>opened my mouth to scream, but it was too late. An invisible</p>
<p>blanket suffocated me beneath its folds. I watched Rixon’s</p>
<p>smiling face swim in and out of focus while I clawed uselessly at</p>
<p>the blanket. My lungs expanded, threatening to burst, and just</p>
<p>when I thought I couldn’t stand it any longer, my chest went soft.</p>
<p>Over Rixon’s shoulder, I saw Patch move into the doorway.</p>
<p>I tried to call out to him, but the desperate need to draw air</p>
<p>dissolved.</p>
<p>It was over.</p><p>

<p></p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>NORA?”</p>
<p>I tried to open my eyes, but while my brain relayed the</p>
<p>message, my body wasn’t listening. A slur of voices drifted in</p>
<p>and out. Somewhere in the back of my mind I knew the night</p>
<p>was warm, but I felt bathed in cold sweat. And something else.</p>
<p>Blood.</p>
<p>My blood.</p>
<p>“You’re okay,” Detective Basso said as I cried out, my voice</p>
<p>sounding strangled. “I’m right here. I’m not going anywhere.</p>
<p>Stay with me, Nora. Everything is going to be fine.”</p>
<p>I tried to nod, but still felt as if I existed somewhere outside</p>
<p>my body.</p>
<p>“Paramedics are taking you to the ER. They’ve got you on a</p>
<p>gurney. We’re on our way out of Delphic right now.”</p>
<p>A few hot tears tumbled down my cheeks, and I blinked my</p>
<p>eyes open. “Rixon.” My tongue felt slippery, the words stumbling</p>
<p>out. “Where’s Rixon?”</p>
<p>Detective Basso’s mouth pinched at the edges. “Shh. Don’t</p>
<p>talk. You took the bullet in the arm. Flesh wound. You got lucky.</p>
<p>Everything’s going to be fine.”</p>
<p>“Scott?” I said, just now remembering. I tried to raise myself</p>
<p>up, but found Iwas strapped down. “Did you get Scott out?”</p>
<p>“Scott was with you?”</p>
<p>“Behind the electrical box. He’s hurt. Rixon shot him, too.”</p>
<p>Detective Basso yelled at one of the uniformed officers</p>
<p>standing off to the side of the ambulance, and he jumped to life,</p>
<p>striding over. “Yes, sir, Detective?”</p>
<p>“She says Scott Parnell was in the mechanical room.”</p>
<p>The officer shook his head. “We searched the room. Nobody</p>
<p>else was in there.”</p>
<p>“Well, search it again!” Detective Basso shouted, flinging his</p>
<p>arm at Delphic’s gates. He turned to me. “Who the hell is</p>
<p>Rixon?”</p>
<p>Rixon. If the police had found no one else in the mechanical</p>
<p>room, it meant he’d escaped. He was out there somewhere,</p>
<p>probably watching from a distance, waiting for his second</p>
<p>chance at me. I grappled for Detective Basso’s hand, clutching</p>
<p>it. “Don’t leave me alone.”</p>
<p>“Nobody’s leaving you alone. What can you tell me about</p>
<p>Rixon?”</p>
<p>The gurney bounced across the parking lot, and the</p>
<p>paramedics hoisted me into the back of the ambulance.</p>
<p>Detective Basso pulled himself up, taking a seat beside me. I</p>
<p>barely noticed; my attention had run off in another direction. I</p>
<p>had to talk to Patch. I had to tell him about Rixon—</p>
<p>“What does he look like?”</p>
<p>The sound of Detective Basso’s voice yanked me back. “He</p>
<p>was there. Last night. He tied Scott in the back of his truck.”</p>
<p>“That guy shot you?” Detective Basso spoke into his radio.</p>
<p>“Suspect’s name is Rixon. Tall and skinny, black hair. Hawk</p>
<p>nose.Age twenty, give or take.”</p>
<p>“How did you find me?” My memory was slowly sewing itself</p>
<p>back together, and I remembered seeing Patch step into the</p>
<p>doorway to the mechanical room. It was only for a split second,</p>
<p>but he was there. I was sure of it. Where was he now? Where</p>
<p>was Rixon?</p>
<p>“Anonymous tip. The caller told me I’d find you in the service</p>
<p>room at the bottom of the Tunnel of Doom. It seemed like a long</p>
<p>shot, but I couldn’t ignore it. He also said he’d take care of the</p>
<p>guy who shot you. I thought he was referring to Scott, but you tell</p>
<p>me Rixon is responsible. Want to tell me what’s going on?</p>
<p>Starting with the name of this guy who’s got your back, and</p>
<p>where I can find him?”</p>
<p>Hours later, Detective Basso slowed against the curb in front of</p>
<p>the farmhouse. It was edging up toward two in the morning, and</p>
<p>the windows reflected the starless sky. I’d been released from</p>
<p>the ER, cleaned and bandaged. While the hospital staff had</p>
<p>spoken with my mom over the phone, I hadn’t. I knew I was</p>
<p>going to have to talk to her sooner or later, but the hustle and</p>
<p>bustle of the hospital hadn’t seemed like the right place, and I’d</p>
<p>shaken my head no at the nurse when she’d held out the phone</p>
<p>to me.</p>
<p>I’d also given my statement to the police. I was pretty sure</p>
<p>Detective Basso thought I’d hallucinated seeing Scott in the</p>
<p>mechanical room. I was pretty sure he thought I was withholding</p>
<p>information on Rixon, too. He was right about the latter, but even</p>
<p>if I told Detective Basso everything, he wasn’t going to find</p>
<p>Rixon. Patch clearly had, however—or at least had made it</p>
<p>known that was his plan. But I knew nothing beyond that. I’d</p>
<p>carried my heart in my throat since leaving Delphic, wondering</p>
<p>where Patch was, and what had happened after I blacked out. We swung out of the car, and Detective Basso walked me to</p>
<p>the door.</p>
<p>“Thanks again,” I told him. “For everything.”</p>
<p>“Call if you need me.”</p>
<p>Inside, I flicked on the lights. In the bathroom, I peeled out of</p>
<p>my clothes, my progress hampered by the fact that the upper</p>
<p>half of my left arm was swathed in bandages. The tang of fear</p>
<p>and panic was fresh on my clothes, and I left them in a heap on</p>
<p>the floor. After wrapping my bandages in plastic, I climbed into</p>
<p>the steam of the shower.</p>
<p>As the hot water drummed down on me, scenes from earlier</p>
<p>tonight replayed in bursts across my mind. I pretended the</p>
<p>water could wash away all of it, carrying everything I’d been</p>
<p>through down the drain. It was over. All of it. But there was one</p>
<p>thing I couldn’t wash away. The Black Hand.</p>
<p>If Patch wasn’t the Black Hand, who was? And how did</p>
<p>Rixon, a fallen angel, know so much about him?</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, I toweled off and checked the home</p>
<p>phone for messages. One call from Enzo’s, seeing if I could</p>
<p>take a shift tonight. An irate call from Vee demanding to know</p>
<p>where I was. The police had kicked her out of the parking lot</p>
<p>where I was. The police had kicked her out of the parking lot</p>
<p>and closed down the amusement park—but not before telling</p>
<p>her they could personally assure her that I was safe, and would</p>
<p>she please drive home and stay there? She ended the call by</p>
<p>shouting, “If I missed out on some really big action, I’m going to</p>
<p>be royally pissed off!”</p>
<p>The third message was from an unknown caller, but I</p>
<p>recognized Scott’s voice the minute he started talking. “If you</p>
<p>tell the police about this message, I’ll be long gone before they</p>
<p>track me down. Just wanted to say sorry one more time.” He</p>
<p>paused, and I heard a smile inch into his voice. “Since I know</p>
<p>you’re worried sick about me, I thought I’d let you know I’m</p>
<p>healing, and I’ll be good as new in no time. Thanks for the tip</p>
<p>regarding my, uh, health.”</p>
<p>A tiny smile broke inside me, and the weight of the unknown</p>
<p>lifted. Scott was okay after all.</p>
<p>“It was nice knowing you, Nora Grey. Who knows. Maybe this</p>
<p>isn’t the last you’ll hear of me. Maybe we’ll cross paths in the</p>
<p>future.” Another pause. “One more thing. I sold the Mustang. Too</p>
<p>conspicuous. Don’t get too excited, but I bought you a little</p>
<p>something with the extra cash. I heard you’ve had your eye on a</p>
<p>Volkswagen. The owner is dropping it by tomorrow. I paid for a</p>
<p>full tank of gas, so make sure she delivers.”</p>
<p>The message ended, but I was still staring at the phone. The</p>
<p>Volkswagen? For me? I was dazed with delight and baffled</p>
<p>surprise. A car. Scott had bought me a car. In an attempt to</p>
<p>return the favor, I deleted the message, erasing all evidence</p>
<p>he’d ever called. If the police found Scott, it wouldn’t be</p>
<p>because of me. Somehow, I didn’t think they’d find him anyway.</p>
<p>Phone in hand, I called my mom. I wasn’t going to put this off</p>
<p>any longer. I’d come too close to death tonight. I was amending</p>
<p>my life, cleaning out and starting fresh, and I was doing it now.</p>
<p>The only thing left standing in my way was this call.</p>
<p>“Nora?” she answered in a panicked voice. “I got the</p>
<p>detective’s message. I’m on my way home right now. Are you all</p>
<p>right? Tell me you’re all right!”</p>
<p>I drew a shaky breath. “I am now.”</p>
<p>“Oh, baby, I love you so much. You know that, right?” she</p>
<p>sobbed.</p>
<p>“I know the truth.”</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>“I know the truth about what really happened sixteen years</p>
<p>ago,” I said more clearly.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? I’m almost home. I haven’t been</p>
<p>able to stop shaking since I hung up with the detective. I’m a</p>
<p>wreck, an absolute wreck. Do they have any idea who this guy —this Rixon—is? What he wanted with you? I don’t understand</p>
<p>how you got dragged into this.”</p>
<p>“Why couldn’t you have just told me?” I whispered, tears</p>
<p>brimming my eyes.</p>
<p>“Baby?”</p>
<p>“Nora.” I’m not a little girl anymore. “All those years you lied</p>
<p>to me. All those times I went off on Marcie. All those times we</p>
<p>laughed at the Millars for being stupid and rich and tactless—”</p>
<p>My voice caught.</p>
<p>I’d been brimming with anger earlier, but I didn’t know how to</p>
<p>feel now. Upset? Weary? Lost and all in a jumble? My parents</p>
<p>had started out doing Hank Millar a favor, but obviously grew to</p>
<p>love each other … and me. We’d made things work. We’d been</p>
<p>happy. My dad was gone now, but he still thought about me. He</p>
<p>still cared about me. He would want me to keep what was left of</p>
<p>our family together instead of running away from my mom.</p>
<p>It’s what Iwanted too.</p>
<p>I sucked in some air. “When you get home, we need to talk.</p>
<p>About Hank Millar.”</p>
<p>I microwaved a mug of hot chocolate and carried it to my</p>
<p>bedroom. My first reaction was to feel fear over being all alone</p>
<p>in the farmhouse, knowing Rixon could be running free. My</p>
<p>second reaction was a quiet calm. I couldn’t say why, but</p>
<p>somehow, I knew I was safe. I tried to remember what had</p>
<p>happened in the mechanical room moments before I fell</p>
<p>unconscious. Patch had walked into the room….</p>
<p>And then I drew a blank. Which was frustrating, because I</p>
<p>sensed more to the memory. It danced just out of reach, but I</p>
<p>knew it was important.</p>
<p>After a while, I gave up trying to recapture the memory, and</p>
<p>my thoughts took a sharp, alarming turn. My biological father</p>
<p>was alive. Hank Millar had given me life, then given me up to</p>
<p>protect me. Right now, I had no desire to contact him. It was too</p>
<p>painful to even think about approaching him. It would be</p>
<p>admitting he was my father, and I didn’t want that. It was hard</p>
<p>enough keeping my real dad’s face in my memory; I didn’t want</p>
<p>to replace that picture or fade it any faster than it already would.</p>
<p>No, I’d leave Hank Millar right where he was—at a distance. I</p>
<p>wondered if someday I’d change my mind, and the possibility</p>
<p>terrified me. Not only the fact that I had a whole other life hidden</p>
<p>away, but the fact that once I uncovered it, the life I currently had</p>
<p>would be altered forever.</p>
<p>I didn’t have any desire to dwell on Hank further, but there</p>
<p>was one thing still not adding up. Hank hid me away as a baby</p>
<p>to protect me from Rixon because I was a girl. But what about</p>
<p>Marcie? My—sister. She had as much of his blood as I did.</p>
<p>Then why didn’t he hide her? I tried reasoning it out in my head,</p>
<p>but I didn’t have an answer.</p>
<p>I’d just curled under the blankets when there was a knock at</p>
<p>the door. I set the mug of hot chocolate on the nightstand. There</p>
<p>weren’t too many people who would be stopping by this late at</p>
<p>night. I padded downstairs and peered into the peephole. But I</p>
<p>didn’t need the peephole to confirm who stood on the other side</p>
<p>of the door. I knew it was Patch from the way my heart couldn’t</p>
<p>carry a steady rhythm.</p>
<p>I opened the door. “You told Detective Basso where to find</p>
<p>me. You stopped Rixon from shooting me.”</p>
<p>Patch’s dark eyes assessed me. For half a moment, I saw a</p>
<p>string of emotions play out inside them. Exhaustion, worry,</p>
<p>relief. He smelled of rust, stale cotton candy, and dank water,</p>
<p>and I knew he’d been close by when Detective Basso found me</p>
<p>in the heart of the fun house. He’d been right there the whole</p>
<p>time, making sure Iwas safe.</p>
<p>time, making sure Iwas safe.</p>
<p>He wrapped his arms around me and held me tight, clutching</p>
<p>me against him. “I thought I got there too late. I thought you were</p>
<p>dead.”</p>
<p>I curled my hands into the front of his shirt and bent my head</p>
<p>against his chest. I didn’t care that I was crying. I was safe, and</p>
<p>Patch was here. Nothing else mattered.</p>
<p>“How did you find me?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I’d thought for a while it was Rixon,” he said quietly. “But I</p>
<p>had to make sure.”</p>
<p>I looked up. “You knew Rixon wanted to kill me?”</p>
<p>“I kept picking up clues, but I didn’t want to believe them.</p>
<p>Rixon and Iwere friends—” Patch’s voice cracked. “I didn’t want</p>
<p>to believe he’d cross me. When I was your guardian angel, I</p>
<p>sensed someone was out to kill you. I didn’t know who, because</p>
<p>they were being careful. They weren’t actively meditating on</p>
<p>killing you, so Iwasn’t getting much of a picture. I knew a human</p>
<p>wouldn’t cover their thoughts that carefully. They wouldn’t know</p>
<p>their thoughts were transmitting all kinds of information to</p>
<p>angels. Every now and then I’d get a flash of insight. Little things</p>
<p>that made me look at Rixon, even though I didn’t want to. I set</p>
<p>him up with Vee so I could keep a closer watch on him. Also</p>
<p>because I didn’t want to give him any reason to think I was onto</p>
<p>him. I knew the only reason he’d kill you was for a human body,</p>
<p>so I started digging into Barnabas’s past. That’s when I figured</p>
<p>out the truth. Rixon was two steps ahead of me, but he must</p>
<p>have found out after I tracked you down and enrolled in school</p>
<p>last year. He wanted to sacrifice you as much as I did. He did</p>
<p>everything he could to convince me to give up on the Book of</p>
<p>Enoch so Iwouldn’t kill you and he could.”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you tell me he was trying to kill me?”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t. You fired me as your guardian angel. I physically</p>
<p>couldn’t intervene in your life when it came to your safety. The</p>
<p>archangels blocked me every time I tried. But I found a way</p>
<p>around them. I figured out I could make you see my memories</p>
<p>while you were sleeping. I tried to give you the information you’d</p>
<p>need to figure out Hank Millar was your biological dad, and</p>
<p>Rixon’s Nephilim vassal. I know you think I abandoned you when</p>
<p>you needed me most, but I never gave up searching for a way to</p>
<p>warn you about Rixon.” His mouth tugged up on one side, but it</p>
<p>was a tired gesture. “Even when you kept blocking me.”</p>
<p>I realized I was holding my breath and slowly released it.</p>
<p>“Where is Rixon now?”</p>
<p>“I sent him to hell. He’s never coming back.” Patch stared</p>
<p>straight ahead, his eyes hard, but not angry. Disappointed,</p>
<p>maybe. Wishing for a different outcome. But underneath it all, I</p>
<p>suspected he was suffering more than he let on. He’d sent his</p>
<p>closest friend, and the one person who’d been at his side</p>
<p>through everything, to face an eternity of darkness.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry,” Iwhispered. We stood in silence a moment, both of us replaying our own</p>
<p>image of Rixon’s fate in our heads. I hadn’t seen it firsthand, but</p>
<p>the image I conjured up was gruesome enough to send a</p>
<p>shudder right through me.</p>
<p>Finally Patch said in my thoughts, I’ve gone rogue, Nora. As</p>
<p>soon as the archangels figure it out, they’ll come looking for</p>
<p>me. You were right. I don’t really care about breaking rules.</p>
<p>I felt the mad impulse to push Patch out the door. His words</p>
<p>drummed in my head. Rogue? The first place the archangels</p>
<p>would look was here. Was he being deliberately careless? “Are</p>
<p>you crazy?” I said.</p>
<p>“Crazy about you.”</p>
<p>“Patch!”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, we’ve got time.”</p>
<p>“How do you know?”</p>
<p>He staggered back a step, with his hand over his heart. “Your</p>
<p>lack of faith hurts.”</p>
<p>I only looked more sternly at him. “When did you do it? When</p>
<p>did you go rogue?”</p>
<p>Earlier tonight. I dropped by here to make sure you were</p>
<p>safe. I knewRixon was at Delphic, and when I sawthe note on</p>
<p>your counter saying that’s where you’d gone, I knew he was</p>
<p>going to make his move. I broke with the archangels and went</p>
<p>after you. If I hadn’t broken with them, Angel, I physically</p>
<p>couldn’t have stepped in. Rixon would have won.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Iwhispered.</p>
<p>Patch held me tighter. I wanted to stay in his embrace and</p>
<p>ignore everything but the feel of his strong, solid body, yet there</p>
<p>were questions that couldn’t wait.</p>
<p>“Does this mean you’ll no longer be Marcie’s guardian</p>
<p>angel?” I asked.</p>
<p>I felt Patch smile. “I’m a private contractor now. I choose my</p>
<p>clients, not the other way around.”</p>
<p>“Why did Hank hide me but not Marcie?” I turned my face into</p>
<p>his shirt so he wouldn’t see my eyes. I didn’t care about Hank.</p>
<p>Not at all. He was nothing to me, and yet, in a secret place in my</p>
<p>heart, I wanted him to love me as much as Marcie. I was his</p>
<p>daughter too. But all I saw was that he’d chosen Marcie over</p>
<p>me. He’d sent me away and doted on her.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” It was so quiet I could hear him breathing.</p>
<p>“Marcie doesn’t have your mark. Hank does, and Chauncey did.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s a coincidence,Angel.”</p>
<p>My eyes traveled to the inside of my right wrist, to the dark</p>
<p>slash that people often mistook as a scar. I’d always thought the</p>
<p>birthmark was unique. Until I met Chauncey. And now Hank. I</p>
<p>had a feeling the meaning behind the mark went deeper than</p>
<p>linking me biologically to Chauncey’s bloodline, and it was a</p>
<p>frightening thought.</p>
<p>“You’re safe with me,” Patch murmured, caressing my arms.</p>
<p>After a beat of silence, I said, “Where does this leave us?”</p>
<p>“Together.” He lifted his eyebrows in question and crossed</p>
<p>his fingers, as if begging for luck.</p>
<p>“We fight a lot,” I said.</p>
<p>“We also make up a lot.” Patch reached for my hand and</p>
<p>pushed my dad’s ring off the tip of his finger and into my palm,</p>
<p>curling my fingers around it. He kissed my knuckles. “I was</p>
<p>going to give this back earlier, but it wasn’t finished.”</p>
<p>I opened my palm and held the ring up. The same heart was</p>
<p>engraved on the underside, but now there were two names</p>
<p>carved on either side of it: NORA and JEV.</p>
<p>carved on either side of it: NORA and JEV.</p>
<p>I looked up. “Jev? That’s your real name?”</p>
<p>“Nobody’s called me that in a long time.” He stroked his</p>
<p>finger across my lip, assessing me with his soft black eyes.</p>
<p>Desire melted through me, hot and urgent.</p>
<p>Apparently feeling the same way, Patch shut the door and</p>
<p>turned the lock. He flipped the main light off, and the room</p>
<p>settled into darkness, lit only by the moonlight sifting through the</p>
<p>drapes.At the same time, our eyes shifted to the sofa.</p>
<p>“My mom’s coming home soon,” I said. “We should go to</p>
<p>your place.”</p>
<p>Patch ran a hand across the shadow of stubble along his jaw.</p>
<p>“I have rules about who I take there.”</p>
<p>Iwas getting really tired of that answer.</p>
<p>“If you showed me, you’d have to kill me?” I guessed, fighting</p>
<p>the urge to feel irritated. “Once I’m inside, I can never leave?”</p>
<p>Patch studied me a moment. Then he reached into his</p>
<p>pocket, twisted a key off his key chain, and slipped it into the</p>
<p>front pocket of my pajama top.</p>
<p>“Once you’ve gone inside, you have to keep coming back.”</p>
<p>Forty minutes later, I discovered which door the key unlocked.</p>
<p>Patch pulled the Jeep into Delphic amusement park’s vacant</p>
<p>parking lot. We crossed the lot hand in hand, a cool summer</p>
<p>breeze tangling my hair in my face. Patch creaked the gate</p>
<p>open, holding it while I passed through.</p>
<p>Delphic had a completely different feel without the barrage of</p>
<p>noise and carnival lights. A quiet, haunted, magical place. A</p>
<p>discarded soda can scraped the pavement as the breeze</p>
<p>pushed it along. Sticking to the walkway, I kept my eyes</p>
<p>fastened on the dark skeleton of the Archangel rising up against</p>
<p>the black sky. The air smelled like rain. A distant grumble of</p>
<p>thunder reeled overhead.</p>
<p>Just north of the Archangel, Patch pulled me off the walkway. We climbed the steps to a utility shed. He unlocked the door</p>
<p>just as a pattering of rain spilled from the sky, dancing on the</p>
<p>pavement. The door swung shut behind me, shrouding us in</p>
<p>stormy darkness. The park was eerily quiet, except for the</p>
<p>steady rat-a-tat of rain splattering the roof. I felt Patch move</p>
<p>behind me, his hands on my waist, his voice soft in my ear.</p>
<p>“Delphic was built by fallen angels, and is the one place the</p>
<p>archangels won’t go near. It’s just you and me tonight,Angel.”</p>
<p>I turned, absorbing the heat of his body. Patch tipped my chin</p>
<p>up and kissed me. The kiss was warm and sent a shiver of</p>
<p>pleasure through me. His hair was damp from rain, and I could</p>
<p>smell a faint trace of soap. Our mouths slipped over each other,</p>
<p>our skin slick with rain that dripped through the low ceiling,</p>
<p>sprinkling us with little pricks of cold. Patch’s arms enveloped</p>
<p>me, holding me with an intensity that only made me want to sink</p>
<p>deeper into him.</p>
<p>He sucked some of the rain from my bottom lip, and I felt his</p>
<p>mouth smile against mine. He swept my hair aside and kissed</p>
<p>me just above the collarbone. He nibbled at my ear, then sank</p>
<p>his teeth into my shoulder.</p>
<p>I hung my fingertips on his waistband, tugging him closer.</p>
<p>Patch buried his face in the curve of my shoulder, his hands</p>
<p>flexing over my back. He gave a low groan. “I love you,” he</p>
<p>murmured into my hair. “I’m happier right now than I ever</p>
<p>remember being.”</p>
<p>“How very touching.” A deep voice carried out of the darkest</p>
<p>part of the shed, along the back wall. “Seize the angel.”</p>
<p>A handful of overly tall young men, undoubtedly Nephilim,</p>
<p>came out of the shadows and surrounded Patch, twisting his</p>
<p>arms behind his back. To my confusion, Patch let them do it</p>
<p>without resistance. When I start fighting, run, Patch spoke to my thoughts, and I</p>
<p>realized he’d stalled fighting to speak to me, to help me find a</p>
<p>way out. I’ll distract them. You run. Take the Jeep. Do you</p>
<p>remember howto hot-wire it? Don’t go home. Stay in the Jeep</p>
<p>until I find you—</p>
<p>The man who lingered at the back of the shed, commanding</p>
<p>the others, stepped forward into a hazy ray of light slicing</p>
<p>through one of the shed’s many cracks. He was tall, lean,</p>
<p>handsome, unnaturally young-looking for his age, and dressed</p>
<p>impeccably in a white country-club polo and cotton twill pants.</p>
<p>“Mr. Millar,” Iwhispered. I couldn’t think of anything else to call</p>
<p>him. Hank seemed too informal; Dad seemed revoltingly</p>
<p>intimate.</p>
<p>“Let me introduce myself properly,” he said. “I’m the Black</p>
<p>Hand. I knew your father Harrison well. I’m glad he’s not here</p>
<p>now to see you debasing yourself with one of the devil’s brood.”</p>
<p>He wagged his head. “You’re not the girl I thought you’d grow up</p>
<p>to be, Nora. Fraternizing with the enemy, making a mockery of</p>
<p>your heritage. I believe you even blew up one of my Nephilim</p>
<p>safe houses last night. But no matter. I can forgive that.” He</p>
<p>paused with significance. “Tell me, Nora. Was it you who killed</p>
<p>my dear friend Chauncey Langeais?”</p>
