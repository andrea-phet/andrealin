    <h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Andrea. I'm currently a junior at Fairview High School. I volunteer at my local hospital. At the moment, I am an intern at <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu/">PhET Interactive Simulations</a>, and I am developing the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/html/projectile-motion/1.0.0-dev.1/projectile-motion_en.html">projectile motion simulation</a>. I'm interested in policy debate, machine learning, geometry, and probability.</p>

          <p>As a third year volunteer at my local hospital in Louisville, Colorado, I have worked at the Information Desk, Nutrition Services, and (currently) New Life. I bring a smile and offer my time for about three to four hours each week to help with anything, including delivering dinner to patients' rooms, monitoring security through the front doors, and walking people to their rooms.</p>

          <h4>May. 2016 - Present</h4>
          <p>In the summer before junior year, I began an internship at PhET, a project to create free interactive math and science simulations. As their first high school intern and student worker in QA and development, I initiated projects with the Director of Development, including pair programming on common libraries with lead developers, designing all sorts of algorithms from the geometry of a necklace to a cubic-solver, leading meetings and shared ideas through collaboration with designers, and networking on behalf of PhET at the International Society for Technology in Education 2016 conference. I am the lead developer on the in-development physics simulation <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/html/projectile-motion/1.0.0-dev.1/projectile-motion_en.html">projectile motion</a>, which is designed to teach students about projectiles and trajectories, components of velocity, acceleration, forces, and drag.</p>

      <summary>Machine learning and geometry (Personal Statement #1 for RSI Application)</summary>
      <div class="left">
        <p><i>Articulate why the research fields chosen on the previous page are intriguing and exciting to you. For each sub-field, state what you perceive as the one or two most interesting questions or problems in this area. Explain why these sorts of questions interest you.</i></p>
        <p>Computer science, especially machine learning, intrigues me. Computers are automated machines that make discrete calculations, but with the current advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence, they can also become like living organisms.</p>
        <p>According to experts in psychiatry, the brain is the most complex object in the universe; in many ways, its performance is much higher than any computer. However, we can program a computer to algorithmically imitate the human brain, such as through neural networks. As systems modeled on the human’s vast connection of axons that conduct signals from neurons, neural networks have the ability to deduct patterns from large sets of data using neural units that send out signals of 0s or 1s. It amazes me that we can program machines consisting of on-and-off switches to reflect the workings of the mysterious brain, an organ so abstract it can foster emotions such as my excitement for neural networks.</p>
        <p>Not only can computers mimic a brain, but they can also mimic the universe. Take the genetic algorithm, for example. It is a search method that borrows ideas from evolution and natural selection. While natural selection finds the best set of genes through survival-of-the fittest, the genetic algorithm seeks the best solution to a problem. In nature, the genetic algorithm took us through evolution from single-celled bodies to fully-fledged homo sapiens. I often imagine what would happen if we used the algorithm to evolve the entire universe on a computer. This may seem far-fetched, but just a fraction of that could help us find the cure for cancer or our next president of the United States.</p>
        <p>To me, the most interesting question in the study of genetic algorithms surrounds the crossover method. Specifically, how can we design crossover to better imitate biological processes? In biology, evolution occurs through natural selection--individuals who are fit are more likely survive and produce offspring. However, how do two individuals within a species choose to reproduce with each other? Could we use the idea of “opposites attract” to find more optimal combinations of traits? Among the steps of the genetic algorithm, it is mutation that typically plays the role of diversifying the solutions, but adjusting the crossover step could give us novel opportunity to find different solutions.</p>
        <p>My second research field, geometry, is intriguing to me because it is abstract. Oftentimes, there are few words needed, yet diagrams can reveal really powerful and amazing ideas. Furthermore, geometry is exciting because of the connections that can be made.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, I embarked on a novel-writing journey to explore connections. I sought a fictional creation that was connected to the entire world; that exploration culminated in a self- published book titled Connections. The storyline is centered around a mysterious city that is connected to the rest of the cultural universe through astonishing correlations and causations.</p>
        <p>To me, geometry is that mysterious city. I can find countless connections between two things that seem completely different. I love to make wacky guesses and come up with best-scenario conjectures. A paper by Sam Vandervelde revealed to me a mind blowing connection between cubics and the area of a triangle. First, we know we can find the area of a triangle using Heron’s formula, in which the expression (s-a)(s-b)(s-c) appears. This looks like a cubic in s with roots a, b, and c. Then, suppose we didn’t start with the triangle; suppose we started with that cubic and then used its roots as side lengths to build a triangle. Then we can use coefficients in this very same cubic to find the area of this triangle!</p>
        <p>I am excited about Vandervelde’s idea because I totally did not see it coming. True, there may be few real world applications to finding the area of a triangle made by a cubic. It may not teach us much about advanced math concepts like differential equations or big unsolved math problems in the world like NP-complete problems. (However, we did just find a connection between the area of a triangle and a third-degree polynomial, so maybe a triangle could also teach us something about algorithms that run in nondeterministic polynomial time?) However, this connection is powerful because we rarely think about using a polynomial to determine a shape, and then finding the shape’s area using coefficients within that polynomial.</p>
        <p>Now, the connection that interests me the most: the relationship between vectors and complex numbers in geometry. How are these two representations of a point in space similar, and how are they different? In what ways are they connected? I love thinking about how 2D can be represented as an x and a y component as well as a real and a complex part. Exploring these two representations could reveal surprising relationships that beget even more relationships, and I'm interested in revealing unorthodox and elegant ideas in our diagrams.</p>

      <summary>Long-range goals (Personal Statement #2 for RSI Application)</summary>
      <div class="left">
        <p><i>What are your long-range goals?</i></p>
        <p>My long-range goal is to use my programming experience and skills to make a difference in the world. A surgeon can help one patient in the operating room, but a computer scientist can help millions of patients by programming the technology that the surgeon uses. There are many ways to change people’s lives for the better; in my foreseeable future, I have a couple goals.</p>
        <p>The first is to pursue a research project within the next ten years. I want to delve deep into a specific question, get a taste of rigorous scientific research, and contribute to society's knowledge and curiosity. Specifically, I’d like to contribute to the research surrounding neural networks. Deep learning has led to a lot of exciting discoveries and advancements. I read that after millennia of playing Go, we have finally created a computer (AlphaGo) who can beat the best human. A lot has been done to make a computer intelligent; however, we are still very far off. For instance, a computer can recognize images with 95% accuracy, but an adult human is almost always 100% correct. Depending on the application, that 5% gap can amount to a lot.</p>
        <p>I’d like to conduct research that helps us reduce the gap between artificial and human intelligence. I would like to take a combination of computer science and biology classes, read up on current studies about deep learning, and experiment with algorithms that may help us improve machines. I want to investigate how to reduce the time it takes to train on a dataset, how to debug the mystery of the black box, and how to collect more complete and clean data.</p>
        <p>I also have a development goal. I want to develop something big, like git, or Linux, or something genius like that within the next thirty years.</p>
        <p>Right now, I do coding for PhET Interactive Simulations, a project founded by physics nobel laureate Carl Wieman at the University of Colorado Boulder. PhET creates free interactive math and science simulations based on education research and has delivered over 360 million simulations out to students on six continents. My main work right now is developing the simulation projectile motion. My goal is to publish my work before this summer so that college, high school, and middle school students and teachers can start out their physics classes in the school year 2017-2018 with a fun and enlightening simulation. Since projectile motion is HTML5 compatible, a wide range of devices, from Chromebooks to iPads to Windows desktops, can access this simulation. Due to translation work throughout the summer, students and schools of all financial situations and all countries from Albania to Vietnam will be able to master the skill of separating velocity into x and y components through my project.</p>
        <p>My work gives me a platform to developing something big. By starting out with writing a program that helps physics students across the world, I have a path to developing applications that help developers around the world. By developing a simulation based on extensive education research at PhET, I am on track to creating libraries, programming languages, and operating systems that are based on scientific findings.</p>
        <p>In math, I have a more modest goal. I don’t pursue world recognition for answering one of the top science questions of the decade, such as whether there are extra dimensions in space. To me, math can be pure and separate from acknowledgement and praise. In high school and college, I’d like to do a lot of problem solving, preferably with a partner or two. I’d like to ask random questions that beget even more random questions, and then perhaps prove the answer to one of them. I want to puzzle through a math problem, come up with multiple conjectures along the way that may end up having no proofs, and resort to bashing it out on the computer.</p>
        <p>Lastly, my goal is to get to know, work with, and share experiences with people. This is a lifelong goal. I want to meet eager young scientists like me and prominent adults in our scientific society today. I want to surround myself with people who love to learn and are always improving themselves and what they do. I would love to get to know MIT’s math department and/or Boston’s computer science related organizations. In September of last year, I had the opportunity to meet Dr. Wieman, and we talked with each other about what we were working on. Learning about his research career motivated me to continue reaching for my goals. He started out in physics research but soon became interested in education, and now he attends professor meetings for both physics and education at Stanford. It is a unique combination of two research fields that have very different atmospheres. I look up to him as my role model because I, too, strive to straddle activities that are very different in nature.</p>

      <summary>Debate, math, and my internship (Personal Statement #3 for RSI Application)</summary>
      <div class="left">
        <p><i>What activities and/or hobbies demonstrate your leadership, creativity and uniqueness?</i></p>
        <p>First, Speech and Debate demonstrates who I am as a leader and why I am unique.</p>
        <p>As a leader, I am passionate, bright, and optimistic. As a sophomore and still an underclassman, I applied and was chosen to be captain. I have been captain since, and I have led my team to compete in dozens of tournaments. That included meeting new debaters after school to lecture them on the basics of debate. It included organizing dinner trips to our local Pho restaurant to promote team spirit. It included encouraging freshmen during our annual fundraiser to put on a brave face and shamelessly sell chocolates during their LA classes. It included weekly meetings with the other captains to plan our next month’s curriculum and pushing all policy debaters to meet at a cafe every Sunday afternoon for research. Most importantly, it included assuming responsibilities beyond what I am used to. Everyone is responsible for themselves, but as captain, I am responsible for the team.</p>
        <p>I am unique because I am passionate about scientific subjects like math and computer science, but I also love debate and philosophy. I bring habits I foster from math and computer programming, such as hard work and attention to detail, to the world of persuasion and argumentation. I bring experience from hundreds of debate rounds, such as extensive research, clear communication, and deep analytical skills, to monthly Colorado math circle meetings.</p>
        <p>Second, my math activities outside of school demonstrate my creativity.</p>
        <p>I am quick to reach out to others, and when confronting math challenges, peers come to me first for my insights. I am open-minded when learning and excel in collaborating with peers to come up with creative solutions—love those aha moments!</p>
        <p>Alone, I can only do so much, but when I am working with others, we help each other reach new heights and discoveries. Whenever I work with my friends or other peers on a math problem, it's like we're building upon each other. We jump on each other’s ideas and provide the leverage for each other to find new insights. We would start on a math problem and I would have this crazy idea, and my friend who is faster and more accurate could use that idea to solve the problem. That’s when I get obsessively excited; the excitement is contagious, or if not, funny and lightens the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Finally, my internship at PhET Interactive Simulations demonstrates my initiative and willingness to step outside my comfort zone.</p>
        <p>Over the summer, I put myself out there, working eight hours a day, five days a week, at a nationally known physics team that creates the very same math and science simulations I have been taught with in school. As their first high school intern, I have had the opportunity to dabble in all aspects of their development. Those include designing the learning goals and user interfaces of the simulations, writing the code for a simulation, practicing test-driven development (TDD), and networking at international conferences.</p>
        <p>I lead teams of adults during design meetings. The first meeting I led was rough. I had no idea how the design process worked, and to me it looked like a lot of arguing rather than brainstorming, and more throwing up hands rather than ideas. But I soon learned the beauty of the design process. The designers showed me the value of tossing around an idea so much it has been perfected by the end.</p>
        <p>I adopted that attitude and found my own creative solutions. For example, one of my first projects was programming the geometry of a necklace to make it look more natural rather than like a rigid ellipse. I explored many interpolation ideas with the original programmer, Sam Reid. In the end, after many tries, Sam and I settled on an algorithm that pulled the beads away from the center, like outward gravity or magnetic repulsion. The result, for PhET, was a realistic and aesthetically pleasing necklace and, for me, was a valuable experience in algorithms, debugging, and working with adults.</p>
        <p>PhET is both a professional business atmosphere as well as a one-of-a-kind nonprofit team. I attended international conferences to network for our project, and I also made 9am trips to Starbucks with the other developers. I learned JavaScript both through the assigned reading for newly hired PhET developers (Effective JavaScript) and also through chatting about programming with Steele Dalton, PhET's quality assurance guy and an aspiring video game designer, during our morning walks from the bus stop. I learned from the Director of Development Ariel Paul how to manage a team of ten developers who each have their working quirks, and also how to find cafes in the city of Boulder with the most delicious smoothies. Both the professional and casual types of learning and interacting are valuable first-time experiences for me. PhET is my first taste of the community of developers in Boulder, Colorado. I was able to say "hello world" to the world of technology.</p>

      <summary>The lady in the bed and tutoring Julie (Personal Statement #4 for RSI Application)</summary>
      <div class="left">
        <p><i>Describe your participation in extracurricular or community outreach activities?</i></p>
        <p>I have been volunteering at my local hospital since freshman year. To me, hospitals feel scary. Unnerving images come to mind, such as outlandish devices, uncomfortably sterile bedsheets, and blinding metal sinks. I remember the common scene when it seemed like the patient was the helpful volunteer and I was the scared patient...</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>I roll my food cart into room 206 and silently wince as the wheels bump against the bed. The old lady in the bed smiled at me affectionately and nodded knowingly.</p>
        <p>I immediately felt at ease, but then the irony hit me. I am the volunteer here. I am the one who knocked on the door with a "nutrition services here" call. I am supposed to be the friendly face who greets the patient in bed with a hearty meal.</p>
        <p>But here, our roles were switched. I was the nervous new volunteer, victim to the imposing green walls and terrifying cords lying everywhere. I was the girl who felt that she was a budding adult outside Avista Adventist Hospital, but once inside, felt stripped down to a small toddler with little knowledge. And this woman, lying horizontal on the bed, IV fluids attached, was comforting me with her smile.</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>Oftentimes, giving your time to the community can mean getting help back.</p>
        <p>Before I first started volunteering at the hospital, I had expected my work to look like a scene on TV. I envisioned myself in a white lab coat, injecting syringes of saline solutions into rows of clear tubes one minute, and frantically running down the halls with bawling newborns the next.</p>
        <p>What I got was different. My volunteer work consisted of sitting behind a desk and pushing a button that opens the front door. I chopped up strawberries and opened dozens of cans of pineapples every other week. I pushed food carts into countless rooms, terrified I would mess up the words “Hello, your dinner is ready. And could I get your name and date of birth?”</p>
        <p>But my volunteer work is not all what you see on the surface.</p>
        <p>Despite the awkwardness and the fear of not knowing what to do, I have continued volunteering at Avista throughout high school. It has been one of the rare chances that I get to help someone else with their life, rather than the other way around. Everyone is helping me: my parents, teachers, coaches ... even my younger sister because she can cook and I cannot. At Avista, I can be the helper. I can take the trays from our kitchen staff and send them around so that they can rest and catch some dinner. I can cut buckets worth of strawberries so they can prepare the next meal for the hospital inpatients. I can bring a smile to our patients, whether it is with my competent and soothing words, or (more likely) my hilarious awkward stumbles.</p>
        <p>My whole life I've wanted to help. On the first day of high school, I signed up as a volunteer in our school’s tutoring center. As a freshman, it was awkward. Almost every day I severely questioned myself what I was doing there, mentally battling over if I was good enough to teach the others. Oftentimes, I begged other students to let me help them, because I felt that I had ways of explaining concepts that would make sense to them.</p>
        <p>And one day, two years later, a student begged me to help her in math. Her name is Julie. To say tutoring Julie was a struggle for me is an understatement. At one point, after I told her that the quantity x plus three (end quantity) squared was not just x plus nine, she threw up her pencil and asked me, “why does all of this matter? It’s not like I’m gonna be walking down the streets and someone is going to come up to me and ask, how do you complete the square on x plus six x plus eight? Why do I have to learn this?”</p>
        <p>At the time, I sputtered something about needing to complete the square to master algebra, needing algebra to master calculus, needing calculus to master physics, and needing physics to build bridges. But, in my head, I knew that her question really challenged me. Why learn math?</p>
        <p>In the tutoring center, Julie learns math because she has to. She might be performing at her concert in Florida next week, and ten thousand people will be paying eighty dollars each just to attend the meet-and-greet-Julie after the concert. Julie can’t go if she fails her math grade, so I am there to help her. You’re lucky, she told me. You get to meet me for free.</p>
        <p>I agree. I am lucky. Tutoring Julie every week opens my mind to a whole new world and challenges me to think about what I do and love and why it matters. Yes, math matters due to its real world applications, but math is also powerful. My math teacher once challenged me, when you think about the grand history of humans, what is remembered? Of course there are politics and historical movements, he said, but also great visual art, music, literature, philosophy, scientific discoveries--and real mathematics. The things that we find important on a day-to-day basis, such as what someone on the street may ask Julie, are mostly lost on a longer timescale.</p>

      <summary>Why the Research Science Institute (Personal Statement #5 for RSI Application)</summary>
      <div class="left">
        <p><i>How did you hear about RSI? What aspects most appeal to you? Why did you apply?</i></p>
        <p>I heard about RSI from one of my senior friends last year. Her science fair project on optical fibers intrigued me, and she told me she researched at RSI.</p>
        <p>The research motivation and collaborative atmosphere is what appeals to me the most. A summer at RSI would be an intensive and exciting way to completely submerge myself into the scientific research process. All the while, I would have an entire community of young scientists and experienced mentors at my side. I also heard that there are trips to the city or sites such as Lincoln Labs, where the department of defense conducts research on national security technology. I have extensively debated and researched on the philosophical and scientific aspects of national security and surveillance (the 2016-2017 policy debate topic), so I would love to visit places like Lincoln Labs.</p>
        <p>The general science classes in the first week of camp are also appealing to me. In my experience, summer camp classes bring a vastly new and different set of approaches to the knowledge I learn in school. For example, probability in the Elementary Functions class at my high school means permutation and combination formulas, but probability at AwesomeMath summer camp means Catalan numbers.</p>
        <p>I applied to RSI because I would be able to meet accomplished high schoolers from across the world with dreams to do something great or with extreme addictions to science. I also applied because I believe I would be able to help these high schoolers when we are all under pressure. For instance, this year I knew that my friends would need help during finals week. So I worked hard and paid attention all semester, so I didn’t cram-study during finals week. Instead, I dedicated hours to helping my friends study.</p>
        <p>The application process has taught me a lot. I discovered a lot about myself and about my relationship with my teachers, mentors, and supervisors. Applying has taught me how to reach out to opportunities and has helped me recognize my goals.</p>

      <summary>The Masquerade (Short Story for PIB LA 9)</summary>
      <p><strong>The Masquerade</strong></p>
      <div class="tab">
        <p>“Heyyy Lillian!” A pebble hit Lillian’s window with a plink, and she groaned. Easton Hammel had been constantly bothering her about what she was wearing to the ball, even after she had refused to tell him. She and Easton had been best friends since they were toddlers, and there was never a secret she kept from him. This time, however, was different.</p>
        <p>The richest girl in town, Daisy Delamarte, had invited Lillian to the annual ball that was held in North Abbington. Everyone in the town Abbington knew Lillian as the first half of LillianandEaston, since they were always together. This time, she wanted to escape her identity and be someone other than the-poor-farmer’s-girl-who-was-always-with-the-poor- blacksmith’s-son.</p>
        <p>Another plink came. Lillian yanked open the window and shouted below: “No, I TOLD you already! I’m keeping my dress a secret!”</p>
        <p>Easton put his hands up and opened his mouth in mock surprise. “Whoah there! I’ve just an announcement.” Easton made a grand gesture of clearing his throat, and then said in a high pitched voice, “This year’s ball has been changed into a masquerade, so please dress accordingly.”</p>
        <p>Lillian’s heart pounded with the possibilities. A masked ball was the perfect chance to hide her identity. And it would be an especially good chance to shake off Easton’s company. Lillian normally felt comfortable spending time with him, unless they were in a public area. Easton gave off the vibe of a silly boy from the South Abbington streets everywhere he walked.</p>
        <p>It was a chance to finally hang out with the Delamartes and North Abbington neighbors as one of the them. The rich ones. Her mind filled with images of her dancing, laughing, her hair waving in the glimmer of the lights, with her arms lazily around a rich gentleman’s neck…</p>
        <p>She was already going to wear her mother’s white dress and add some party trinkets to tone down the wedding air. But now that it was a masquerade, she could turn the dress into an angel costume! No toning down for an angel would be needed.</p>
        <p>To get an inexpensive but still elegant mask, Lillian turned to the flea market in the very south of South Abbington. She found a beautiful mask that was strikingly white with creamy pearls. It was neither comfortable nor cheap, but it was worth it. It was perfect for her since it covered almost all of her face, and it was perfect for an angel.</p>
        <p>When the sky darkened, Lillian carefully tucked her costume into a purse and headed for the blacksmith’s shop.  Easton was already waiting outside. Together, they walked to North Abbington.</p>
        <p>The Delamarte palace was beautiful all year, but tonight it was especially highlighted. Lights illuminated every Delamarte family crest hanging from the towers; mini lamps lined the stone pathways; and beautiful violin music surrounded the lawn. Flowers hung over every archway and the servants were all dressed in fine phoenix costumes.</p>
        <p>“Easton? I’m going to leave to change, alright? I’ll see you in there.”</p>
        <p>Easton nodded eagerly. “Go ahead! And don’t get too crazy--we’ve got to be back by eleven.” With that, he bounded off.</p>
        <p>Lillian frowned. Why didn’t Easton pester her about her costume? She shrugged. Fewer lies to fabricate.</p>
        <p>She went into a small changing tent to put on her costume. The mask pinched her nose even more than it did when she was trying it at the market. Feeling rather naked and new-born in her angel costume, she made her way back to the glowing palace.</p>
        <p>Lillian took a deep breath, adjusted her mask, and stepped through the gold doors. She was confronted by a flurry of masks and dancers -- bears, pegasi, phoenixes, cats, mermaids… It was overwhelming. She spotted some people from Southern Abbington in the corner, recognizing them by their worn out boots. She almost headed over there, but then she remembered. Tonight she wouldn’t be Lillian. She would be the rich guest of the Delamartes.</p>
        <p>There were couples all around Lillian that were chatting with each other as they danced to the trumpet - filled spritely tune. Lillian saw animated lips under black cat masks, twinkling eyes shining through the eyelashes of a horse mask, and bare shoulders shaking all around. All of this made Lillian feel uncomfortably alone.</p>
        <p>“Mademoiselle? Would you like to dance with me?”</p>
        <p>Lillian turned around and almost let out a gasp. The finest gentleman in the entire ballroom had his waist bowed down, questioning eyes looking up at her through his beautiful stallion mask. Shiny leather boots, white trousers made of the finest material, and a dark black jacket only the Delamartes and their company would wear. Silver buttons. One. Two. Three.</p>
        <p>Lillian took a deep breath, composed herself, and let out the line she had practiced so many times.“Why, of course!” It came out much higher and squeakier than she had expected, and her heart fell. This gentleman would be sure to notice her mistake. Lillian ‘s hands shook and she felt her palms go clammy and cold as she grasped hands with the gentleman. Her mask slipped a little, but she didn’t dare fix it.</p>
        <p>“How shall I address you, mademoiselle?”</p>
        <p>Lillian panicked. If she told him her name he might recognize her as the poor Lillian from South Abbington.</p>
        <p>“I understand that you may not want to make your name known so easily at a masquerade. I am the same.” He leaned in closer and whispered, “I am going by Romeo, so would you kindly go by Juliet?”</p>
        <p>Lillian nodded.</p>
        <p>As he led her waltzing through the dancers, she realized with the jump in a heart where they were heading. The group with ladies dressed in white and gentlemen dressed in earth colors would definitely be The Delamartes. No wonder Romeo came up to her. She had, by chance, worn the exact dress that would let her fit in with the Delamartes. As she got closer, Lillian expected to feel glorious and successful as people looked at her with awe and realized she was part of the elite. However, she didn’t feel the glory. She simply felt scared, and slightly hysterical.</p>
        <p>They moved into the Delamartes’ circle.</p>
        <p>The trumpeters finished their song. The servants went around the ballroom and blew the candles out, one by one. The only light remaining came from the central chandelier. A dark cello melody rumbled across the hall. In the dark, Lillian stumbled, and her feet gave away from under her.</p>
        <p>The chandelier tumbled amongst shiny sequins and lips and eyes and candles and buttons and masks… A stallion.</p>
        <p>“Are you alright, my lady?” Romeo said.</p>
        <p>“Uh...” Lillian said dizzily. Her masked had slipped, painfully covering her right eye.</p>
        <p>“Juliet,” Romeo said smoothly, “Let me adjust your beautiful mask.”</p>
        <p>Lillian immediately pulled back. “No, oh no, no need.” She took a breath, composed herself, and lifted her chin. “I shall do it myself.”</p>
        <p>Heart pounding, she turned away, shifted the mask, and blinked tears out of her eyes.</p>
        <p>Lillian counted eleven chimes of the clock. Easton said they should have left by now, but she was still stuck in Romeo’s arms, dancing. Lillian bit her lip. What if Easton left without her?</p>
        <p>“I will get you something to drink.” Romeo suddenly said. With that, he bowed and left. At this lucky chance, Lillian ducked out of the Delamartes and headed out the palace. Romeo would have to give that drink to someone else.</p>
        <p>Lillian rushed along the cobble-stoned streets, panting loudly. Her high heels pattering against the quite stones were claps of thunder to her sensitive ears. She yanked off her angel mask and moaned at the relief. She was already late, so she decided not to take her costume off. She’d have to hope Easton didn’t notice an angel-dressed “lady” dancing with the Delamartes.</p>
        <p>Lillian actually couldn’t wait to see him. She needed someone to pour the whole truth to. Someone whom she could tell about how she tried to act like a rich girs but failed miserably. How she thought she’d have a better life spent away from her poor but familiar friends. How she felt so uptight and ready to cry having to fake everything in front of the Delamartes. Lillian really needed her best friend right now.</p>
        <p>He was already waiting for her next to the carriage, elbow against the door, face red. He must have been running late as well.</p>
        <p>“Easton! I’m so glad--” Lillian stopped sharply. Leather boots. A black jacket. Silver buttons, one, two, three. A stallion mask in his left hand. How did she not recognize him?</p>
        <p>“Romeo,” she whispered in disbelief.</p>

      <p><strong>Wisp of Happiness</strong></p>
      <p>By Andrea</p>
      <p>There was once this time,<br>
        In my life, of my life,<br>
        Far back in my past.<br>
        It was a simple moment,<br>
        A sliver, a scrap,<br>
        Of pure happiness.<br>
        <br>
        That was hope.<br>
        It’s a streak of sun,<br>
        Across my life of simple shades of moonlight.<br>
        A blur of light,<br>
        Stretching over the timeline of my life,<br>
        For how long I can not say.<br>
        <br>
        So long ago it seems,<br>
        That I’d felt that warmth,<br>
        Of the joyous sparkle.<br>
        Yet time didn’t matter,<br>
        In that golden period.<br>
        It simply was.<br>
        <br>
        It is my longing to relive that streak,<br>
        Of golden sun.<br>
        The hope of going back to the a blur of light,<br>
        Dwells permanently in my dreams.<br>
        My quest is to retrieve,<br>
        That sprinkle of joyous sparkle.<br>
        <br>
        It’s natural to want.<br>
        To ache for more periods of pure white light,<br>
        Are quite desperate dreams for all.<br>
        I not only wish to spread it on life,<br>
        But to search the source.<br>
        The source of that unclouded daffodil mist.<br>
        <br>
        Only the idea that a decade would have given that moment,<br>
        Enough time to disappear, to deny existence.<br>
        With hope if it shall have survived,<br>
        Would my sight see it;<br>
        Would my outstretched hands,<br>
        Grasp that wisp,<br>
        <br>
        Of happiness?</p>
